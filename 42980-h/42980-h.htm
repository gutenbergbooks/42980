<h2>MISSISSIPPI'S "BACKWOODS POET."</h2>

<div class="center">BY DABNEY LIPSCOMB, A. M.</div>


<p>To awaken greater interest in what, however estimated,
Mississippians have accomplished in the field of literature, to
provoke research into even its remote and unfrequented corners;
and, chiefly, to place more prominently before the people of his
much-loved State a poet too little known, is the double purpose
of this essay.</p>

<p>The poet needs no introduction and offers no apology on his
entrance into the domain of history; for he is no intruder there,
entitled indeed to a place of honor in the proudest capitol of
that noble realm. Homer precedes Herodotus and makes his
record doubly valuable. The poet is in fact the maker in large
measure of the history of the world. Through his entrancing
and inspiring voice the aspirations of humanity have been elevated,
ideals lofty in thought and deed have been constantly
upheld, and will to dare and do the utmost in the cause of
liberty and righteousness has been imparted in the hour of need.
In the poet's verse we read, as nowhere else, the inner throbbing
life of man. High or low his ascent of Parnassus, his words have
a charm for us, if the Muse has bidden him welcome; and the
nearer he is to us the more apt he will be to express our peculiar
griefs and joys in his melodious strains.</p>

<p>Hence, it is with pleasure, that the claims of Mississippi's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
"Backwoods Poet" to our affection and appreciation are now
presented. Perhaps he is not the greatest of the thirty or forty
that might be named who in our State have as poets achieved
more or less local distinction. He modestly disclaimed such
honor, and assumed himself the title of "Backwoods Poet"
which has been given him. S. Newton Berryhill, of Choctaw
(now Webster) county, Mississippi, is his proper name. He
was born October 22, 1832, and died Dec. 8, 1887.</p>

<p>In the preface of his poems these significant facts are stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While I was yet an infant, my father with his family settled
down in a wilderness, where I grew up with the population,
rarely ever going out of the neighborhood for forty years.
The old log school house, with a single window and a single
door, was my <i>alma mater</i>, the green woods was my campus."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet what he learned in the log school house and the woods
and by subsequent private study would put to shame very many
who have enjoyed far better educational advantages; especially,
when the further disadvantage under which he labored is considered.
Early in life he became the victim of a serious spinal
affection, which rendered him a confirmed invalid, unable the
remainder of his days to stand upon his feet. Despite all these,
to an ordinary man, crushing limitations, he became fairly proficient
in Latin, French, German, and music, in addition to a
thorough knowledge of the usual high school course in English,
science, and mathematics.</p>

<p>To teaching, journalism, and literature he devoted his life.
After a long and creditable career as teacher near his country
home, during which time most of his poetry was written, he
moved, about 1875, to Columbus, Mississippi. In the dingy office
of the old <i>Columbus Democrat</i>, the writer first saw this unquestionably
remarkable man. Cushioned in his wheel chair,
before a desk, busy with his pen, Mr. Berryhill, the editor, saw
not how closely he was observed, nor the look of pity he might
have read in his beholder's face for one so handicapped in the
race of life. But as the massive, thinly covered head was raised,
and the dauntless, lofty spirit of the man shone from the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and deep-set eyes; as the almost cheerful expression of his pallid
countenance was revealed,&mdash;pity gave way to wonder and admiration,
which grew yet more with further knowledge of the
man and his achievements against odds apparently so overwhelming.
How respectfully on bright Sundays when he could
venture out, he was lifted in his chair by friends up the double
flight of steps to the audience room of the church and rolled
down the aisle to the place near the pulpit, sympathetic glances
following him the while, is a picture, too, not soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p>During his stay in Columbus he was elected County Treasurer,
which office he filled acceptably two years. In 1880 he
returned to Webster county, where, as has been stated, he died,
Jan. 8, 1887. Little else, for the lack of information, except that
he was a Methodist and a Mason, can be said of the life and
character of Mr. Berryhill. What more is given must be gathered
from his writings in an inferential way, which for this purpose
and for their literary merit, will repay the examination
now proposed.</p>

<p>The editorials, sound, progressive, and patriotic, must be
laid aside. The rather crude but racy character sketches, Indian
legends, and miscellaneous short stories, written in part during
his quiet closing years, must, also, more regretfully be left unnoticed
for lack of time. His poetry is the work he prized most
highly, and by it his place in literature should be determined.</p>

<p>From boyhood, he was irrepressibly poetic. The spirit of
the woods and hills early descended on him, giving his eye unwonted
keenness in discerning the beauty that surrounded him,
and his ear unwonted delicacy in detecting the melody that
floated in every breeze. Romantic stories of their better days
told him by neighboring friendly Choctaws took deep root in his
youthful fancy and bore fruit in his prose and verse.</p>

<p>In 1878 his poems written during the forty years previous
were published at Columbus in a volume entitled "Backwoods
Poems." Political issues of very serious nature, not altogether
settled, were then too absorbing a theme to Mississippians to
permit them to pay much heed to poetry, however excellent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Hence, the work received less notice than otherwise it would.
But one edition was ever published, and few copies of it can
now be found.</p>

<p>What first strikes the reader as he turns the pages of this
unpretentious little volume is the variety and uniform excellence
of the versification. Under the circumstances, it was natural
to suppose that this poet would attempt little else than the
rhyming couplet and the ballad form of verse. Instead, stanzas
varying greatly in length and rhyme order, with lines from two
to six stresses, iambic and often trochaic in movement, usually
well sustained, soon make a strong impression that no common
poetaster has set the music to these verses.</p>

<p>As to length, not more than half a dozen of the two hundred
twenty-six poems in the collection contain more than one hundred
lines. The longest and leading poem, called Palila, is a
metrical version of a favorite Choctaw legend, numbering one
thousand tetrameter lines. This pathetic story of an Indian
maiden and her ill-starred gallant lover and the upshooting by
the medicine spring of the little flower the pale-face calls the
lady's slipper, but known to red men as Palila's Moccasin, is
told with dramatic effect, and has the atmosphere of freedom
and wildness befitting a tale so weird and sad. Bare mention of
two or three other rather lengthy poems, such as "A Heart's
History," and "The Vision of Blood," will be made, principally
to call attention to the excellence of the blank verse in
which they are written; its ease, accuracy, and vigor are readily
perceived.</p>

<p>The shorter poems may be conveniently classed as anacreontic,
humorous, patriotic, descriptive, and personal. Many of
them, as the author admits, especially those of his youth, are
crude and imperfect, but he explains in a personally suggestive
way that he could not cast out these poor children of his brain
on account of their deformity, and craves indulgence where approval
or applause must be withheld.</p>

<p>The poems of love and humor have little value except for the
light they throw on the poet, who, though deprived of nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the heart holds dear in life, could yet fully sympathize with
youth in its joys and smile genially even on its follies. A few
stanzas from two or three poems in his lighter vein, of which
there are quite a number, will be sufficient to indicate the sunny
side of the poet's nature. First, a little rustic picture:</p>


<div class="center">BETTIE BELL.<br /></div>

<div class="poem">
How sweet she looked in home spun frock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With arms and shoulders bare,</span><br />
And yellow flowers and scarlet leaves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twined in her auburn hair;</span><br />
With saucy lips and fingers plump<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stained by the berries wild;</span><br />
And hazel eyes whose drooping lids<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half hid them when she smiled.</span><br />
<br />
I could have kissed the little tracks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her bare brown feet had made;</span><br />
There was no huckleberry pond<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too deep for me to wade&mdash;</span><br />
There was no rough persimmon tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too tall for me to scale&mdash;</span><br />
If Bettie Bell was standing by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the little wooden pail.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Another with a touch of humor will next be given:</p>


<div class="center">MR. BROWN;<br />
OR CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES.<br />
</div>

<div class="poem">
"O tell me Mary have you seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ugly Mr. Brown</span><br />
With pumpkin head and brimstone hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And manners like a clown!</span><br />
What could have made young Charley Smith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bring such a gawk to town?</span><br />
<br />
He has no breeding, I am sure&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stares at ladies so</span><br />
With those great dumpling eyes of his&mdash;-<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I would like to know</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>How Bettie Jones can condescend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take him for a beau!"</span><br />
<br />
Quoth Mary, "What you say is true;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's awkward and he's plain;</span><br />
But then, you know, he's rich;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wealth with some will gain."&mdash;</span><br />
"Indeed, I never heard of that,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said pretty Martha Jane.</span><br />
<br />
"I only got a glance at him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Mrs. Jenkins' ball;</span><br />
And on acquaintance he may not look<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So ugly after all.</span><br />
I wonder if young Charley Smith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will ask his friend to call!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Even in parody the isolated sufferer would at times seek
self-forgetfulness or diversion. A short one is here inserted
from the author's scrap-book. To a Southerner, the faithfulness
and humor of the selection will be manifest:</p>


<div class="center">A SKETCH.<br /></div>

<div class="poem">
The darkey sat on his stubborn mule,<br />
Day through the west had fled,<br />
And the silver light of the rising moon<br />
Shone on his bare bald head.<br />
<br />
Firm as an Alp the old mule stood&mdash;<br />
An Alp with its crest of snow&mdash;<br />
The darkey thumped, the darkey kicked,<br />
And swore he'd make it go.<br />
<br />
The night wore on, it would not budge<br />
Till it had changed its mind;<br />
And the darkey cursed, the darkey swore<br />
Till he was hoarse and blind.<br />
<br />
At last he saw its big ears twitch,<br />
Its eyes cast back the while;<br />
And felt the skin beneath him writhe<br />
Like a serpent in its coil.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><br />
Then came a yell of wild despair;<br />
The man&mdash;oh! where was he?&mdash;<br />
When the clouds unveil the hidden moon<br />
I think perhaps we'll see.<br />
</div>

<p>In the patriotic poems, chiefly war lyrics, notes louder,
harsher, and even bitter in their tone as the cause seems lost,
strike clear and full upon the ear, disclosing their author as
one of the "fire eaters" of the South, loth to accept the verdict
of the sword and submit to reconstruction. In this gathering,
apart from their connection with the author, two or three of
these poems no doubt will be interesting for their historical
value alone. "<i>The Storm</i>," written April 15, 1861, expresses
in borrowed form but with graphic power the terrible suspense
that then prevailed:</p>

Instead let us take this glimpse into those days of death and

<div class="center">TIDINGS FROM THE BATTLE FIELD.<br /></div>

<div class="poem">
"Fresh tidings from the battle field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A widowed mother stands,</span><br />
And lifts the glasses from her eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With trembling withered hands.</span><br />
"Fresh tidings from the battle field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Your only son is slain;</span><br />
He fell with victory on his lips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a bullet in his brain."</span><br />
The stricken mother staggers back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And falls upon the floor:</span><br />
And the wailing shriek of a broken heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes from the cottage door.</span><br />
<br />
"Fresh tidings from the battle field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wife her needle plies,</span><br />
While in the cradle at her feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her sleeping infant lies.</span><br />
"Fresh tidings from the battle field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Your husband is no more,</span><br />
But he died as soldiers love to die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His wounds were all before."</span><br />
Her work was dropped&mdash;"O God" she moans,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lifts her aching eyes;</span><br />
The orphaned babe in the cradle wakes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And joins its mother's cries.</span><br />
<br />
"Fresh tidings from the battle field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A maid with pensive eye</span><br />
Sits musing near the sacred spot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where she heard his last good-bye.</span><br />
"Fresh tidings from the battle-field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Your lover's cold in death;</span><br />
But he breathed the name of her he loved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his expiring breath."</span><br />
With hands pressed to her snowy brow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She strives her grief to hide;</span><br />
She shrinks from friendly sympathy&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A widow ere a bride.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
"Fresh tidings from the battle field!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O, what a weight of woe</span><br />
Is borne upon their blood-stained wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As onward still they go!</span><br />
War! eldest child of Death and Hell!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When shall thy horrors cease?</span><br />
When shall the Gospel usher in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The reign of love and peace?</span><br />
Speed, speed, the blissful time, O Lord!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blessed, happy years&mdash;</span><br />
When plough-shares shall be made of swords,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pruning hooks of spears!</span><br />
</div>

<p>The lines on Sheridan and Butler express something more
than the poet's righteous indignation at deeds by them in which
he can somehow see neither virtue nor valor. As indicative of
the feelings of the South in the hour of final defeat and subjugation
read "Daughters of Southland" and "My Motherland."
One stanza of the first must suffice:</p>

<div class="poem">
Daughters of Southland, weep no more;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their glory's priceless gem</span><br />
Nor peace, nor war can ever mar;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no change for them.</span><br />
Rejoice! for tho the conqueror's hate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still beats upon our head,</span><br />
Despite our chains there yet remains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The memory of our dead.</span><br />
</div>

<p>How tender and ardent is the patriotism in these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
My motherland! My motherland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though dust is on thy brow,</span><br />
And sack-cloth wraps thy beauteous form,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I love thee better now</span><br />
Than when, arrayed in robes of power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou send'st thy legions forth</span><br />
To battle with the hosts that poured.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From out the mighty North.</span><br />
<hr class="tb" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>My motherland! my motherland!<br />
Thy bravest and thy best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the sod their life-blood stained,</span><br />
In dreamless slumber rest;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thrice happy dead! They cannot hear</span><br />
Thy low, sad wail of woe;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The taunts thy living sons must bear</span><br />
They are not doomed to know.<br />
<br />
My motherland! my motherland!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their spirits whisper me,</span><br />
And bid me in thy days of grief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still closer cling to thee,</span><br />
And though the hopes we cherished once<br />
With them have found a grave,<br />
I love thee yet, my motherland&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The land they died to save.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Whether he spoke for his section in these disdainful and
defiant lines, descriptive of times just after the war, each may
decide for himself:</p>


<div class="center">RE-RECONSTRUCTION.<br /></div>

<div class="poem">
Aye, heat the iron seven times hot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the furnace red of hell;</span><br />
Call to your aid the venomed skill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of "all the fiends that fell,"</span><br />
And forge new links for the galling chain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bind the prostrate South again.</span><br />
<br />
Stir up again your snarling pack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your jackals black and white,</span><br />
That tear her lovely form by day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gnaw her bones by night&mdash;</span><br />
Your sniveling thieves with carpet bags&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your sneaking, whining scalawags!</span><br />
<hr class="tb" />
Villains, go on; each blow you strike<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To glut your hellish hate,</span><br />
But welds in one all Southern hearts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And state unites to state;</span><br />
And lo, compact our Southland stands&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A nation fashioned by your hands.</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is in the poems personal and descriptive that we get
close to this poet's heart. There will be found what gave most
solace to his circumscribed and lonely life. In nature as she
was most attractive to him, and in lines to loved ones young and
old, plaintive often but never rebellious or morose, the placid,
self-restrained, yet inspiring nature of the man is brought to
clearest view. Fervid in his love for beauty, he bowed none the
less devoutly at the shrine of duty.</p>

<p>"The Old School House," "The Deserted Home," "Autumn,"
"The Frost and the Forest," "My Castle," "Lines on
the Death of My Father," "My Old Home," and the last poem
"Unfinished," are representative of the class that best reflects
the poet and the man; and by their pensive beauty perhaps take
firmest hold upon the reader. It is difficult to offer satisfactory
illustrations without being too lengthy; but these will prove at
least suggestive:</p>


<div class="center">AUTUMN.</div>

<div class="poem">
Let nobler poets tune their lyres to sing<br />
The budding glories of the early spring,&mdash;<br />
Its gay sweet-scented flowers and verdant trees<br />
That graceful bend before the western breeze.<br />
Be mine the task to chant in humble rhyme<br />
The lovely autumn of our own bright Southern clime.<br />
<br />
No more the sun from the zenith high,<br />
With fiery tongue licks brook and riv'let dry;<br />
But from beyond the equinoctial line&mdash;<br />
Where crystal waters lave the golden mine&mdash;<br />
Aslant on earth he pours his mellow beams,<br />
Soft as the memories which light old age's dreams.<br />
</div>

<p>The following poem can be given entire, as it is short:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="center">THE FROST AND THE FOREST.</div>

<div class="poem">
The Frost King came in the dead of night&mdash;<br />
Came with jewels of silver sheen&mdash;<br />
To woo by the spinster Dian's light,<br />
The pride of the South&mdash;the Forest Queen.<br />
<br />
He wooed till morn, and he went away;<br />
Then I heard the Forest faintly sigh,<br />
And she blushed like a girl on her wedding day,<br />
And her blush grew deeper as time went by.<br />
<br />
Alas, for the Forest! the cunning Frost<br />
Her ruin sought, when he came to woo;<br />
She moans all day her glory lost,<br />
And her blush has changed to a death-like hue.<br />
</div>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Berryhill's best known poem is one that is
personal and yet quite fanciful. It can be found in Miss
Clarke's "Songs of the South." Two or three stanzas will be
sufficient:</p>

<div class="center">MY CASTLE.</div>

<div class="poem">
They do not know who sneer at me because I'm poor and lame,<br />
And round my brow has never twined the laurel wreath of fame&mdash;<br />
They do not know that I possess a castle old and grand,<br />
With many an acre broad attached of fair and fertile land;<br />
With hills and dales, and lakes and streams, and fields of waving grain,<br />
And snowy flocks, and lowing herds, that browse upon the plain.<br />
In sooth, it is a good demesne&mdash;how would my scorners stare,<br />
Could they behold the splendors of my castle in the air!<br />
<br />
The room in which I am sitting now is smoky, bare and cold,<br />
But I have gorgeous, stately chambers in my palace old.<br />
Rich paintings by the grand old masters hang upon the wall<br />
And marble busts and statues stand around the spacious hall.<br />
A chandelier of silver pure, and golden lamps illume,<br />
With rosy light, on festal nights the great reception room.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>When wisdom, genius, beauty, wit, are all assembled there,<br />
And strains of sweetest music fill my castle in the air.<br />
<hr class="tb" /><br />
The banks may break, and stocks may fall, the Croesus of to-day<br />
May see, to-morrow, all his wealth, like snow, dissolve away.<br />
And the auctioneer, at panic price, to the highest bidder sell<br />
His marble home in which a king might well be proud to dwell.<br />
But in my castle in the air, I have a sure estate<br />
No panic with its hydra head can e'er depreciate.<br />
No hard-faced sheriff dares to levy execution there,<br />
For universal law exempts a castle in the air.<br />
</div>

<p>Little remains to be said. This singular life, with an estimate
of the quality and quantity of its work has been unfolded
as faithfully as possible.</p>

<p>With greater interest, the dominant motive of the author,
so frankly stated, may now be joined, without comment, to his
mournful retrospect of his life work. The first is found in the
lines from Mrs. Hemans inscribed on the title page of "Backwoods
Poems."</p>

<div class="center">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&mdash;&mdash;"I'd leave behind</span><br />
Something immortal of my heart and mind."<br />
</div>

<p>This is his salutatory. In the closing stanza of the last
poem "Unfinished," the retrospect is made, and his valedictory
delivered thus:</p>

<div class="center">
"My canvas is not full; a vacant space<br />
Remains untouched. To fill it were not meet&mdash;<br />
I'll leave it so&mdash;like all that bears a trace<br />
Of me on earth&mdash;Unfinished&mdash;incomplete."<br />
</div>

<p>To Hayne, Lanier, and Maurice Thompson, S. Newton Berryhill
must yield in subtlety of melody and penetrative insight
into nature's deeper meanings. Timrod and Ticknor in their
war lyrics may, at times, have struck the martial chord with
stronger and more dextrous hand; but it may still be justly
claimed that the best of the "Backwoods Poems" compare favorably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with much or even most of the work of these more famous
Southern poets.</p>

<p>If in this paper this claim has been established, its purpose
is abundantly fulfilled, and the "Backwoods Poet" in environment
and achievement stands out a unique figure in the literature
of the State.</p>

<h2>MISSISSIPPI AS A FIELD FOR THE STUDENT OF LITERATURE.</h2>

<div class="center">BY W. L. WEBER.</div>


<p>Dr. Sam Johnson is sponsor for the stock illustration of
history reduced to its lowest terms. His story is with reference
to the Natural History of Iceland by the Danish Historian Horrebow.
The learned Dane undertook to write an exhaustive account
of the wintry island. Chapter Seventy-two of this history,
so the story goes, had as its title the attractive phrase,
Concerning Snakes. The Chapter itself, long famous for telling
the whole truth in the fewest words, consists of one sentence:
There are no snakes to be met with throughout the whole island.</p>

<p>With similar parsimony of words, if we are willing to adopt
one of the almost universally accepted definitions in which
beauty and permanence and universality are made the final tests
of literature&mdash;if we are willing to accept so narrow a definition
we may find ourselves able to write the history of Mississippi
literature in one sentence. Such a history would be&mdash;in the
brutal directness of Horrebow's phrase: There is no literature to
be met with throughout the whole State.</p>

<p>But as for me, this humiliating conclusion is not to be
agreed to, for I decline to be shackled by so narrow limitations.
Literature has a wider meaning than is given to it in this esthetic
definition, a definition which must exclude everything
written by Mississippi authors. There ought to be general
agreement to the commonplace that literature is life embodied in
the pages of books. "Good literature is" therefore "an open
door into the life and mode of thought of the time and place
where it originated."
On this side of our work the departments
of literature and of history are one and inseparable. There can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>be no genuine history of a people which fails to take into account
the distinctly intellectual life of that people. The student of
policies and of institutions must needs seek the help of him
whose care is to trace literary currents and together they must
labor by painstaking study of the writings of Mississippians to
conjure up by some verbal necromancy, the literary genius and
spirit of the people of the State. We are not going too far, then,
in asserting that all written monuments that in any way reflect
and set forth the intellectual life of the people are rightly to be
enumerated in the lists of Mississippi literature.</p>

<p>But even after we have insisted on this wider definition of
literature, Mississippi has few grounds for boasting. The list of
Mississippi books is not long; the average quality is not high.
Of pure literature, of the real literature of power, we have contributed
scarcely fifty pages to the world's store. We may deceive
ourselves and gratify our state pride by wild claims, but
after the joy of self-glorification is over we shall be forced to the
conclusion that our place in literary history is an humble one.
Some part of this result is doubtless due to sham admiration of
our literature. We have delighted to praise our books without
stint; we have preferred to buy the books of others. To praise
is easy; to read is weariness to the flesh. We have, therefore,
praised extravagantly; we have read vicariously. It does not
come within the range of this paper to suggest why Mississippi
has contributed so much more to politics than to literature.
Preference for the hustlings and the madding crowds rather than
for the desk and its quiet enthusiasms must be accepted as a fact,
let him who will account for it. Nor is this the place to argue
that a local literature is a contradiction in terms. Our desire
is to see the day when Mississippi shall have writers whom succeeding
generations will delight to number among those who
have contributed to the world's best thoughts, adequately expressed.</p>

<p>My purpose is not to tickle your ears with a panegyric on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
what Mississippi has done in the field of literature, not to
apologize for her confessed shortcomings, not to prophesy excellence
as the certain outcome of the future. My purpose is a
humbler one. I take for granted that there are in the state
young men with literary aspirations. I wish to suggest to such,
some lines of work that need to be done, and to be done at once.
It is my hope that such work will be valuable in furnishing a
store house of literary material and that the labor of accumulation
will be admirable discipline preparing the students for creative
effort&mdash;if haply they be so endowed as to be able to do work
for all time.</p>

<p>To make my suggestions altogether practical, I shall draw
up a list of channels in which the student of Mississippi literature
may profitably direct his activity. (It may not be amiss
just here to call your attention to the fact that by my subject-title
I am restricted to that aspect of our subject which has to
do with the interests of the students and have, therefore, no
direct connection with the immediate interests of the author.)
Turning our attention to student-work, I may as well express
my opinion that we have no noble specimens of literary art to
which the student may turn to make critical examination of the
method and purposes of literary interpretation. We have little
that may claim place even in the ranks of third and fourth rate
productions. With the single exception of the poems of Irvin
Russell, Mississippi has produced nothing which literary men
have been willing to accord a place in the literature of America.</p>

<p>It is perhaps too soon to prophesy whether his place is a permanent
one or not. It is, however, evident that the Mississippi
student must look for a humbler class of work than that of constructive
criticism. Having little material to which the rules of
esthetic criticism may be profitably applied, and having no desire
to be enrolled in the large and ignoble army of criticasters,
our student must look for a less inviting field of activity. Yet
he has the consolation of knowing that even journeyman work
if it be well done is altogether worth doing. And even if we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not yet at a stage in our literary history when we can afford to
claim the right to subject our material to the tests reserved for
noble literary models, we may wisely believe that ours is the
work which will prepare the ground from which will spring up
a harvest every way worthy of our beautiful fields of our eventful
history, of our noble people.</p>

<p>Having agreed as to what class of work may come under a
professedly literary review of Mississippi writings, we are
minded to take stock of our property. Being under the conviction
that everything which sets forth Mississippi life is worthy
of consideration, we may conclude that every Mississippi book
has a right to be included in the subject matter worthy of the
attention of a Mississippi student. Justin Winsor learned by
experience that every printed document was worthy of preservation
in the great library of Harvard University and we shall
find that no contribution of a Mississippi pen is unworthy of
our care. I may call your attention to the fact that much writing
of real merit is of a fugitive character and appears only to
sink back into the oblivion of musty files of country newspapers.</p>

<p>The first work, then, to which I should assign my student
is the compilation of a bibliography of Mississippi literature. So
far as I know there is no man who knows how many books have
been written by our own authors. A confessedly incomplete list
of my own compilation reveals the name of many a work the
Mississippian of average intelligence has never so much as heard
of. As has already been suggested, I should not confine the list
to an enumeration of bound volumes. Every pamphlet a copy
of which may be had, or the actual appearing of which is assured,
ought to be listed in the Bibliography of Mississippi Literature.
At the very outset of our labors, we are met with a problem that
meets the student of the literature of every section of the United
States. What constitutes a Mississippi book? Are we to proceed
on the doctrine that once a Mississippian, always a Mississippian
and include in our enumeration the books of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
writer that has been in the State? If so, Jas. A. Harrison, a
native born Mississippian, a Virginian by adoption, is to adorn
our lists. Must we add all books written on Mississippi soil?
If so, we are to include many volumes of Maurice Thompson,
who spends his winters on the Gulf Coast, and dates his prefaces
from Bay St. Louis. Are we to include works written by authors
then legally residents of the state, afterwards citizens of
other states? If so, Professors Bledsoe and Hutson are Mississippi
authors. These questions must be settled before we can
have an authoritative bibliography. It has been my custom to
enumerate as ours, all books written by an author resident in
Mississippi at the time of the writing of the volume.</p>

<p>After having completed the bibliography, the student would
naturally turn his attention to the gathering of biographical
facts connected with our own writers. Most of those who have
made books have acquaintances still living. From them we must
get the facts that will enable us to understand what has been
written. The man wrote himself into his book, to be sure, and
the facts of his life are the very best commentary on the book
itself. It is a shame that we have neglected our own writers
and that it was left to Professor Baskervill, a Tennessean, to
give us the only adequate appreciation of Irwin Russell. But
much is left to be done. The student who accumulates the recollections
of Russell's friends and preserves them in the archives
of the Historical Society will be doing a work worth while doing,
a work which will grow in value as the years go by. This field
of biographical study is practically untilled, tho we may cite
as examples of how the work is to be done&mdash;Professor Baskervill's
paper just mentioned, Bishop Galloway's study of Henry
T. Lewis and Professor Lipscomb's account of Berryhill, the
Poet.</p>

<p>After my student had acquired a surer touch in his progress
from compiler of book-lists to painter of life-picture, he would
already be prepared in literary appreciativeness to see and point
out the fine poetry fossilized in the Indian names remaining in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
our state. It is worth while to make lists of all our Indian geographical
names, to discover the meaning of the names so collected
and if possible to find out the circumstances that led to
these names being given to creek, to river, to hamlet, county, as
may be. In some names there is, to be sure, little poetry. The
fact that Shubuta means "sour meal" does not serve as a trumpet
call to the writing of a sonnet; but where there is a lack of
poetry the historical fact of name-origin still remains. Why
may not some Mississippi Lanier sing into fame our rivers, as
the Georgia Chattahoochee has been immortalized by its own
poet?</p>

<p>Connected with Indian names the investigator will find Indian
legends. A rich mine is sure to open before a diligent
worker. The fact that there are different versions of the same
legend makes the material all the more valuable as a field of
study. The student of ethnography as well as the student of
literature finds the history of the Biloxi Indians full of interest.
There is poetry even in the naming of the legend of the singing
waves of the Pascagoula. There are many and complicated
stories connected with the driving of the Natchez Indians from
their ancestral seats. Every year makes the collecting of these
legends more and more difficult. The patriotic Mississippi student
will see to it that they are not lost, but are gathered into
the store house for use in days to come.</p>

<p>Joel Chandler Harris has done a wonderful work for Georgia
and the Atlantic Coast in the collection of Lore. It cannot
be that Uncle Remus had no kinsmen in Mississippi. Yet no one
has sought to preserve these Mississippi versions of negro folk
tales. It will be remarkable if these tales have not been influenced
by Indian admixtures. No student has investigated the
subject to find out whether Mississippi has its distinct group of
Brer Rabbit stories and whether the distinctive quality of our
group is due to contact with Indian legends. Surely nobody
will suggest that the work is not worth while doing. With the
disappearance of the Indian and the complete conventionalizing
of the negro, the opportunity will have passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Not less valuable to the collector of material for the use of
the future maker of Mississippi literature is the full account of
the doings of famous Mississippi outlaws. It may not be too
soon to investigate the deeds of Murrell and his gang. If the
story of his exploits is to become literary property it must be
learned before all his contemporaries have passed off the stage of
life. It is not too much to expect that the William Gilmore
Simms which Mississippi will some day produce may find in the
doings of Murrell material for a story that may compare with
some of the wildest exploits described by the South Carolina
writer. May he who is to portray the early life of our State
be not too slow in the coming.</p>

<p>Who knows but that the Mississippi literary man whom we
confidently expect and to whom we await to do honor&mdash;who
knows but that he may belong to the school of Cable and of Murfree
and may therefore wish to write in dialect. If the student
have some philological training he may wisely prepare for the
writer's coming by collection of word lists&mdash;of words heard in
Mississippi but words that have no literary standing&mdash;words
which are for the most part confined to the use of the illiterate.
Dr. Shands has already collected a list along this line in his
dissertation entitled Some Peculiarities of Speech in Mississippi.
I am sure he is mistaken in thinking that any of his words are
peculiar to Mississippi, but nevertheless his list is valuable as
enumerating expressions that are to be heard in our state&mdash;words
which he who tries to reproduce the speech of Mississippi illiterates
may not be afraid to use.</p>

<p>The student of our literature may wisely include in the
range of his studies all references to Mississippi to be found in the
literature of other sections. Not only such references as those
but all accounts of Mississippi in books of travel have a rightful
place in the collections of him who would gather together the raw
material from which literature may some day be woven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>To the writer of reminiscences the literary student looks
with hopeful eye. From such an one may be had biographical
data, personal traits, literary anecdotes&mdash;in fact all the ana
which the literary student of this day delights in. The humble
collector of this material may not win much of fame for self&mdash;except
so far as that the humbler work well done does not need
to be done again and therefore wins the reward due to honest
endeavor&mdash;But if he gains no reward he may rejoice in the consciousness
that he is making possible the day when Mississippi
may stand as a peer with other Southern States, delight to honor
her own Lanier, her own Harris, her own Cable, her own Murfree,
and her own Allen.</p>

<p>Some one is already asking what's the good of all this?
Such matters may perhaps be wisely assigned as school boy tasks
but there certainly can be but little value in the material after
it has been laboriously collected. The study of literary history
supports the contention that the accumulation of the subject
matter of literature is in necessary precedence to the creative
work of the producer of literature. It will but be in accord
with what has taken place in the past, if a student who sets to
work along lines I have suggested, who accumulates material,
who immerses himself in the history and traditions of his state&mdash;it
will be but natural, I say, if such an one have his heart set on
fire by the enthusiasm engendered by his work and be transformed
from a journeyman toiling over his tasks of accumulator
into literary wizard who by the incantations of his genius may
call forth the spirit of his time. Such work made Walter Scott.</p>

<p>May Mississippi see not another Scott but a literary man
who under new conditions and with new material may create
for Mississippi a new literature which may have like place in
the world's literature with the immortal contributions of the
great Scotchman. When that day comes the Mississippian will
not have on his shoulders the burden of being an apologist and
will not have to compound with his conscience in order to win
the name of being patriotic in matters literary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>I have not hesitated thus to rehearse in your hearing matters
already well-known to you. If I have but retold an old, old
story, I have not deceived myself into thinking that I was telling
you new or startling truths. The old story&mdash;the well known
fact sometimes needs to be reviewed. The fact that it is so well-known,
is so self-evident&mdash;causes it to be overlooked. I am quite
willing to be found fault with for rehearsing at needless length
what everybody knows&mdash;provided only my rehearsing will lead
to these matters being attended to.</p>

<h2>SUFFRAGE IN MISSISSIPPI</h2>

<div class="center">BY HON. R. H. THOMPSON.</div>


<p>That portion of the present State of Mississippi and that
part of Alabama lying between the Mississippi and Chattahoochee
rivers, and bounded on the south by the thirty-first parallel
of latitude and on the north by a line drawn due east from the
mouth of the Yazoo river, was organized into the Mississippi
Territory in pursuance of an act of Congress, approved April 7,
1798. Afterwards, in 1804, the country lying south of the State
of Tennessee and north of the original Mississippi Territory was
added; and in 1812 that portion of the present States of Alabama
and Mississippi lying south of the thirty-first degree of
latitude was annexed. Mississippi became a state in 1817 and
Alabama was then separated from it. This historic statement at
the outset will explain why several matters pertaining to suffrage
in municipalities not now in the state, are hereafter mentioned.</p>

<p>The organic law of the Territory enacted that the people
thereof should "be entitled to and enjoy all and singular the
rights, privileges and advantages granted to the people of the
territory of the United States, northwest of the river Ohio in
and by the ordinance of the thirteenth day of July in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, in as full and
ample a manner as the same are possessed and enjoyed by the
people of the said last mentioned Territory," and thus in our
investigation of the subject we are led to examine the ordinance
referred to, and which we find in the statutes entitled, "An ordinance
for the Territory of the United States Northwest of the
River Ohio," to see if it contains any provision relative to suffrage.
We find it, and the words of this celebrated ordinance
are as follows. "So soon as there shall be five thousand free
male inhabitants, of full age, in the district, upon giving proof
thereof to the governor, they shall receive authority, with time
and place, to elect representatives from their counties or townships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to represent them in the general assembly; provided that
for every five hundred free male inhabitants, there shall be one
representative, and so on progressively with the number of free
male inhabitants, shall the right of representation increase, until
the number of representatives shall amount to twenty-five; after
which the number, and proportion of representatives shall be
regulated by the legislature; Provided that no person be eligible
or qualified to act as a representative, unless he shall have been
a citizen of the United States three years, and be a resident in
the district, or unless he shall have resided in the district three
years, and in either case, shall likewise hold in his own right,
in fee simple, two hundred acres of land within the same; Provided
also, that a freehold of fifty acres of land in the district,
having been a citizen of one of the states, and being resident in
the district, or the like freehold, and two years residence in the
district shall be necessary to qualify a man as an elector of a
representative."</p>

<p>With all due respect to the fathers, nothing in statutory
language could be more awkward; the reading of it, however,
will serve to remind us that the modern legislator cannot claim
originality for his habitual use of the word "provided" as introductory
to amendments, and with which to string his ideas
together.</p>

<p>The last of the three provisos is necessarily a limitation on
the "free male inhabitants, of full age," mentioned at the beginning
of the section, since there is no provision in the ordinance
for the election of any officers save representatives to
the general assembly; all other officers in the scheme of government
here provided were appointive. An analysis of the laws
of 1787, which evidently must be basis of suffrage in a number
of states as well as Mississippi, shows that to entitle a person to
vote under our first suffrage law he must have been (1) Free,
(2) Male, (3) of full age, presumably 21 years, (4) citizen of
the United States and resident of the Territory or a resident for
two years in the Territory and (5) Freeholder of fifty acres of
land in the district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>While this organic law was in force, of course the territorial
legislation was confined, so far as concerns our subject,
to municipal suffrage, but I have thought reference thereto not
without the scope of this paper, since such legislation, perhaps
more than any other, being untrammeled as a general rule by
unyielding constitutional restrictions, throws light upon the
spirit, temper and thoughts of the people on the subject at the
time of the enactment.</p>

<p>Before the amendment of the organic law herein next mentioned
I find but one piece of such legislation; by an act approved
in 1803 the "freeholders, landholders and householders"
of the city of Natchez were authorized by a majority vote to
elect municipal officers, and the act further reads that "for the
better understanding of the meaning of the term householder, it
is hereby declared that any person who shall be in the occupancy
of a room, or rooms, separate and apart to himself, shall be
deemed a householder, and entitled to vote at the annual and
other meetings of the said city: Provided that such occupancy
shall have existed six months next preceding such election." Were
this explanatory enactment omitted it would seem that to entitle
a person to vote he should have been a freeholder and a landholder
and a householder, all three conjointly, but it is apparent
that the legislature did not so intend, since it provided by the
explanation that if he were a householder alone, he would have
been entitled to vote. The explanation, while directed at a
definition of a householder, settles by indirection the only doubt
arising from the text sought to be explained, but unfortunately
the proviso brought with it a greater difficulty than the explanation
had removed, and that was whether other householders
than those directed to be so deemed, were required to have been
such for six months before offering to vote. The phraseology
suggests legislative amendments and indicates a difference of
opinion as to who should be intrusted to vote; but all seem to
have agreed upon permanent residence anchorage to the soil as
an essential qualification, the difference being as to rigidity and
extent to which it should be carried. The most notable thing
about this, the first legislative act of Mississippi conferring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
right of suffrage, is that no distinction is made because of age,
color, or sex. Whether this were by accident or design, and
whether other persons than adult white males really voted thereunder,
does not appear.</p>

<p>By an Act of Congress, approved Jan. 9th, 1808, the organic
law so far as it related to Mississippi Territory, was
amended so as to provide that every free white male person in
the Mississippi Territory, above the age of 21 years, having been
a citizen of the United States, and resident in the said territory
one year next preceding an election of representatives, and who
has a legal or equitable title to a tract of land by virtue of any
act of Congress, or who may become the purchaser of any tract
of land from the United States of the quantity of fifty acres, or
who may hold in his own right a town lot of the value of one
hundred dollars within the said territory, shall be entitled to
vote for representatives to the general assembly of said territory.</p>

<p>The change just made in the suffrage laws of the territory
can best be appreciated by the use of parallel columns.</p>

<p>This act of Congress, passed in 1808, first introduced the
color line.</p>

<p>In 1811 four municipalities were organized by acts of the
territorial legislature, Woodville, Port Gibson, Huntsville and
St. Stevens; the latter two are now in Alabama. In the first one
named the right to vote was conferred on the freeholders and
householders within the town, and in the second the right was
conferred on the landowners, freeholders and householders
within said town, but in each case the grant was followed by a
separate section of the act in these words: "All free male inhabitants,
subject to taxation, who shall be in the occupancy of a
room or rooms separate and apart to himself, shall be deemed
a householder, within the meaning of this act, and shall be entitled
to vote at the town elections." Clearly this section was
intended to enlarge the scope of those who were authorized to
vote and it could not rightfully be construed as narrowing it.</p>

<p>This being true, the freeholder and householders, other than
those mentioned in the quoted section, were empowered to vote
without reference to sex and all without regard to age or color.
In the charter of Huntsville the suffrage was conferred on "all
free white male inhabitants of said town above the age of twenty
one years," and in the case of St. Stevens the right to vote was
given to "the citizens of said town," but this was amended in
1815 so as to limit the right to "landholders, freeholders and
householders."</p>

<p>In January, 1814, the territorial legislature treated the
town of Mobile as an existing municipality, the section of the
country surrounding it, acquired from West Florida, was added
to the territory in 1812, and restricted suffrage to the "landholders,
freeholders and householders within the town," and
followed this with a section in the very language of the one
quoted above from the charters of Woodville and Port Gibson,
but this was amended in 1816 so as to limit suffrage as written
in the following section, viz: "No person shall vote at any election
for president and commissioners, assessor and collector for
the said town, unless he be twenty-one years of age, and shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have been a freeholder in said town, or the tenant of a house or
separate roof at least six months previous to any election and
shall have paid a county, territorial or corporation tax, nor unless
he be a citizen of the United States, or shall have resided
within that part of West Florida now in the possession of the
United States, at the time of the change of government in that
province." The next legislation pertinent was the act of Congress,
approved April 25th, 1814, amending the organic law of
the territory. This provided "Each and every free white male
person, being a citizen of the United States, who shall have attained
the age of twenty-one years, and who shall also have
resided one year in said territory previous to any general
election, and be at the time of any such election a resident
thereof, shall be entitled to vote for members of the house of
representatives, and a delegate to Congress for the territory
aforesaid." The only effect of this act was to dispense with the
property qualification previously prescribed and to substitute
in its place the payment of a county or territorial tax. In 1815
an election was authorized for the purpose of locating the county
seat of Jackson County by act providing simply that such persons
as were authorized to vote for representatives might cast
their ballots thereat, but in 1816 a like act for Adams County
was passed providing "every free male white person, being a
citizen of the county of Adams who shall have arrived at the
age of twenty-one years and resided in the said county twelve
months previous to the said election, shall be admitted to vote
thereat and none other." This brings us to the end of territorial
legislation and from it we learn that ownership of or anchorage
to the soil was a prominent conception of the times; all else as
a necessary qualification for voting, even age, color and sex,
seems to have been subordinate, or accidental or exceptional.
There was certainly no prejudice then in the good old days because
of color; the color idea came from without, from Congress.</p>


<h3>UNDER THE FIRST CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>The constitution under which Mississippi came into the
Union as a state was adopted on the 15th August, 1817, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the first section of Article three thereof, the following provision
is made: "Every free white male person of the age of twenty-one
years or upwards, who shall be a citizen of the United States
and shall have resided in this state one year, next preceding an
election, and the last six months within the county, city or town
in which he offers to vote and shall be enrolled in the militia
thereof except exempted by law from military service; or having
the aforesaid qualifications of citizenship and residence, shall
have paid a state or county tax, shall be deemed a qualified
elector; but no elector shall be entitled to vote, except in the
county, city or town (entitled to separate representation) in
which he may reside at the time of election."</p>

<p>An analysis of this section shows that in order for a person
to be a qualified state and county voter thereunder he must have
been,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(1) Free,<br />
(2) White,<br />
(3) Male,<br />
(4) Twenty-one years of age or upward,<br />
(5) A citizen of the United States,<br />
(6) A resident of the state for at least one year,<br />
(7) A resident of the county, city or town at least six months,<br />
(8) Enrolled in the militia unless exempt therefrom, or he<br />
must have had the "aforesaid qualifications of citizenship and<br />
residence" and have paid a state or county tax.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What our forefathers meant by alternate qualifications is
hard at this day to find out. A literal construction would have
authorized a free white male person having the qualifications of
citizenship and residence to have voted irrespective of age, but
there is no record of infants having exercised the right, nor is
there in our books a judicial interpretation of the constitutional
provision. It is notable, too, in respect to this section of the
fundamental law that crimes did not disfranchise under the
terms of the constitution itself and that the murderer, the thief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<i>et id omne genus</i> are relegated to the legislature so far as voting
was concerned by the 5th section of the sixth article which provides,
"laws shall be made to exclude from office, and from
suffrage, those who shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury,
forgery or other high crimes or misdemeanors." We find,
however, that the legislature in 1822 undertook to perform its
duty in this regard by providing that "no person shall vote at
any election whatever in this state who shall have been convicted
by the verdict of a jury, and the final judgment or sentence of a
court of competent jurisdiction, of bribery, perjury, forgery, or
other high crime or misdemeanor, unless the person so convicted
shall receive a full pardon for such offense."</p>

<p>On the subject of pardons and its effect on the right of suffrage
it may be stated here that the doctrine in this state until
the adoption of the constitution of 1890 was in favor of the
restoration of the right to vote; the constitution just named having
made provision for a legislative restoration of the right to
vote leaves the matter now an open question as concerns executive
pardons.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that by legislative act, approved February
10th, 1821, elections in this state were held <i>viva voce</i>, but
this act remained in force only until June 13th, 1822, the date
of the act repealing it, since which time they have been by
ballot; since 1869 the constitutions have required them to be so.
In truth there is no record of an election held <i>viva voce</i> under
the law of 1821, though the election held on the 1st Monday of
August, 1821, under Sec. 6, Art. 3 of the first constitution must
have been so held. Of course the laws passed under the constitution
of 1817 on the subject of state and county elections conformed
their provisions, defining who should have the right of
franchise to the terms fundamental law on the subject and, as
we have seen, the legislature excluded criminals from the right
to vote, but the lawmakers of that day by no means confined
themselves to the constitutional qualifications when they came to
prescribe who should be entitled to vote in municipal elections;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
for instance, we see that "citizens of the town" were made
voters in Shieldsborough (Now Bay St. Louis) in 1818, in Greenville
(Jefferson county) in 1819, and in Holmesville in 1820;
and "citizens of one month's residence" were allowed to vote on
the subject of the location of the Madison County court house by
act approved 1829, and "free white male citizens of the town
above the age of twenty-one years" were made voters by act incorporating
Pearlington, passed in 1822, and in the same year
"free citizens resident in the town" were made voters in Columbus.
In 1821 "free white male inhabitants, resident of the
town, twenty-one years of age and upwards" were authorized to
vote in Monticello, and in 1831 in Warrenton; and in 1824 such
residents of the county were authorized to vote on the location of
the county seat of Warren County.</p>

<p>By act of 1821 "every free white male person, twenty-one
years old or upwards, an inhabitant of the town for six months
and who had been assessed and paid a town tax within a year,"
were allowed to vote in municipal election at Port Gibson, and
so too were the owners of land in that town, if the land had been
assessed and taxes paid on it, whether the owner resided in the
corporate limits or elsewhere; and I am advised the law of that
town so remained until after the war; the idea has been adopted
by several municipalities of the state in later days. By the early
charters of Vicksburg, approved 1825, and Rodney, approved
1828, suffrage was conferred on "landholders, householders,
freeholders and such as shall have paid a town tax, being inhabitants
and residents for three months in the town."</p>

<p>In 1830 "freeholders and householders" were made voters
in Shieldsborough (now Bay St. Louis) and Raymond, and in
1825 "freeholders and householders," whether resident or not,
were given the right to vote in the town of Washington, and in
1831 the right to elect a constable was given "actual citizens of
Vicksburg, over twenty-one years of age," and in 1830 the "freeholders
and householders" of the town of Washington were required
to be males in order to vote after that date, and the only
qualification of voters in the town of Liberty, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
act of 1819, were that they should be "free white males, resident
citizens of the town," and this is true under the first charter of
Warrenton, approved in 1820. In all these instances the constitution
of 1817 was not regarded as establishing a rule to be applied
to municipal suffrage. By several acts passed while this
constitution was operative the constitutional rule was, however,
adopted in defining who should vote in municipal elections.
Thus in 1821, in respect to the town of Washington the language
is "persons entitled to vote for members of the general assembly,"
and the same language is used in the charter of Clinton,
passed in 1830, and to the same language is added the words,
"and who shall have resided in the town three months" in the
charters of Meadville and Brandon passed in 1830 and 1831
respectively. In the amendment to the charter of Liberty, passed
in 1828, suffrage is limited to "inhabitants of the town under
the restrictions prescribed by the constitution of the state," and
the same language substantially is to be found in the act incorporating
Gallatin approved in 1829.</p>

<p>"The qualified electors" of Jackson county voted on the
subject of the location of their court house under the provisions
of an act passed in December, 1830. The "free white male inhabitants,
residing within the town entitled to vote for members
of the general assembly" were made the electors of the city of
Jackson by the first act of incorporation passed in 1823, and by
legislative grant approved in 1830 incorporating Manchester
(now Yazoo City) the "inhabitants entitled to vote according
to the constitution and laws of the state" were given the right
to participate in municipal elections, and the same language is
used in the charter of Athens, approved in the same year.</p>

<p>An analysis of all this will show that under the constitution
of 1817 "color" was not a qualification or a disqualification
in eight of the towns of the state legislated upon, viz:
Shieldsborough (now Bay St. Louis), Greenville (Jefferson
County), Holmesville, Columbus, Vicksburg, Rodney, Raymond
and Washington. Of course slaves were not freeholders or citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
but free men of color were frequently freeholders and before
the Dred Scott decision were regarded by many as citizens.
It will be noted, too, that sex was not made a qualification or a
disqualification for voting in seven of the towns whose charters
were passed or amended during the period in which the first
state constitution was operative, viz: those, except Washington,
just enumerated. There is no evidence, however, that women
ever voted in any of these towns, and all that can be learned on
the subject leads to the belief that they not only never did but
the right seems never to have been claimed for or by them. Free
persons of color, however, as I learn, did claim the right in some
of these towns and it was generally conceded by those of the
white men whose interest was on the side of the claimant's political
preference, but was generally denied by the opposition, and
it is doubtful if a negro ever voted in any of them until after
the war. On the whole it is not so clear but that the failure to
exclude women and free persons of color in the early legislation
on the subject of voting in municipalities was but the result of
legislative awkwardness and a want of exactness in statutory
exclusion and inclusion.</p>


<h3>UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1832.</h3>

<p>The exact period in Mississippi legal history extends from
1832 to 1869, and embraces the period during which the constitution
adopted in 1832 remained in force. This, the second state
constitution, was adopted October 26, 1832; its provisions on the
subject of suffrage are as follows: "Every free white male person
of the age of twenty-one years or upwards, who shall be a
citizen of the United States, and shall have resided in this state
one year next preceding an election, and the last four months
within the county, city or town in which he offers to vote, shall
be deemed a qualified elector." * * * * * "Every
person shall be disqualified from holding an office or place of
honor or profit under the authority of this state, who shall be
convicted of having given or offered any bribe to procure his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
election. Laws shall be made to exclude from office and from
suffrage those who shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury,
forgery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors." * *
The second of the sections above quoted was acted upon by the
law-making power March 2, 1833, and the following piece of
legislation then became operative:</p>

<p>"No person shall vote at any election whatever in this state,
who shall have been convicted by the verdict of a jury and the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, of bribery,
perjury, forgery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors, unless
the person so convicted shall have received a full pardon for
such offense."</p>

<p>It will be noted that the conviction must have been by the
verdict of a jury and the judgment of the court both conjunctively.
What was the effect if the criminal plead guilty does
not seem to have been considered. Of course the general legislation
of the state on the subject of state and county elections,
conformed to the constitution, and we are again led to examine
the acts incorporating municipalities within the period, and
providing who should be voters therein, in order to obtain light
on the thought of the times relative to our subject.</p>

<p>A great many cities and towns were incorporated during
this period; in a large majority of charters it was simply provided
that the "qualified voters" should exercise the right of
suffrage, thus recognizing the constitutional rule. In many instances
additional qualifications to those named in the constitution
were imposed, thus, residence for a specified time within
the corporate limits was required in 1833 for Columbus, Amsterdam,
Manchester (now Yazoo City), Jackson, Sartartia, Liberty,
Woodville, and in 1836 for Plymouth. But by no means did the
legislatures of the period conceive that they were bound to require
all the constitutional qualifications as essential for municipal
suffrage. A favorite idea was to authorize "every free white
male inhabitant of the town" who had resided therein for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
specified time, to vote in municipal elections. This was the case
in Raymond, by act passed in 1833; Salem, Starkville and Sharon,
1837; Cotton Gin Port, Farmington and Philadelphia, 1838;
Cooksville and Emory in 1839; Hernando, 1840; Gainesville,
1846; Shongole and Camargo, 1850; Sarepta, Hermans, Eastport
and Benela, 1852; Columbus and Aberdeen, 1854 (in the
latter, however, non-resident freeholders were allowed to vote
by the act); Bonner, 1860; Wesson, Beauregard, Hickory and
Hazlehurst, 1865; Lodi, Batesville and Sardis, 1866; Crystal
Springs and Winona, 1867. In addition to the ordinary qualifications
the payment of a town tax was required for Grand Gulf,
1833; Vicksburg, 1833 and 1839; Rodney, 1844; Yazoo City,
1846; Natchez, 1865. During this period, too, a few municipal
charters pursued the language which was so frequently used at
an earlier day&mdash;"freeholders, landowners and householders."
This was the case in the acts for Shieldsborough (now Bay St.
Louis), 1838 and 1850; Pass Christian and Biloxi, 1838, and
Rodney, 1844. In a few instances every adult resident person
was allowed to vote, without reference to race, color, sex or anything
else if the laws were administered as they are written.
This was the case in Macon, 1836; Paulding, 1837, and Raleigh,
1838, and in Brandon, by act of 1833, resident persons were not
excluded by law because of infancy. For liberality of sentiment
on the subject of universal suffrage, Brandon's charter of 1833
is without an equal, but whether this liberality of expression proceeded
from a liberality of feeling or from ignorance in the forms
of expression doth not appear. Registration of voters was first
required in this state by act passed in 1839, and it applied to
municipal elections at Vicksburg only; in 1861 a similar provision
was enacted for Canton, and in 1865 for Natchez. Of late
years a municipal registration is quite common, as we shall see
hereafter.</p>


<h3>UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1869</h3>

<p>By the second section of article seventh, constitution of 1869,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the following qualifications of voters were prescribed; in order
to be a voter a person must have been,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1. Male,<br />
2. Inhabitant of the state; idiots, insane persons and Indians<br />
not taxed excepted,<br />
3. Citizen of the United States, or naturalized,<br />
4. Twenty-one years old or upwards,<br />
5. Resident of the state six months and in county one month,<br />
6. Duly registered.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And by section two, article twelfth thereof, the legislature
was required to pass laws to exclude from suffrage "those who
shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, forgery or other
high crime or misdemeanor."</p>

<p>The public laws of the state, on the subject of state and
county elections, of course conformed to the constitutional provisions;
the section thereof found in the code of 1871 on the subject
of criminals excluded from the right to register and vote
"persons convicted of bribery, perjury, forgery or infamous
crime;" that of 1880 denied suffrage to persons convicted of
bribery, perjury, forgery, grand larceny or any felony.</p>

<p>Under this constitution (1869) of course the negroes were
voters. Much has been said of late years to the effect that the
grant of the right to vote on the negroes by the fifteenth amendment
to the constitution of the United States was a mistake;
perhaps the adoption of that amendment was an error in statecraft;
certainly it proved a party mistake to the Republican
party. But every thoughtful and candid man will doubt the
proposition that the grant of suffrage to the negro was a mistake
when viewed from the standpoint of the negro's welfare. Would
his rights as a citizen have been as soon respected had he remained
deprived of political power? Of course this is a question
that can never be settled. We can only speculate upon it.</p>

<p>The provisions of this constitution, like that of the preceding
ones, were construed by the legislature as applying only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
state and county elections; hence we find that in municipal matters
the provisions of the acts of the legislature passed under it
defining who should vote in city, town and village elections are
variant. It is sufficient to extract from the numerous municipal
charters any governing principle. It is apparent, however, that
the tendency was, perhaps from convenience of expression, to
adopt the constitutional rule, simply adding that the voter should
be a resident of the municipality. In a few instances persons
having "permanent business" in the town were permitted to
vote at municipal elections even though their citizenship and residence
were elsewhere.</p>

<p>This was the case in Bolton, 1871; Quitman, 1880; Laurel,
1886; Scooba, 1886; and non-resident freeholders of the town
were permitted to vote in Senatobia in 1882 and Tunica, 1888.</p>

<p>In a majority of cases the provision was that the voter should
be a qualified elector of the state, or state and county, and that
he should have resided within the municipal limits a specified
time. This time varied greatly, from ten days, the shortest, to
two years. Of the various acts of legislation on this subject I
find thirteen in which the length of residence was required to be
only ten days; one in which the time is fifteen days; eight fixing
twenty days; forty-five prescribing one month; nine fixing two
months; fifteen naming three months; nine prescribing four
months; one fixing five months; twenty-one naming six months;
three fixing one year, and four prescribing two years. The
municipalities in which one year's residence was required are
Pass Christian (a seashore resort), the purpose evidently being
to exclude summer visitors, 1882; Rosedale, 1890; and Durant,
1890. Those in which two years' residence was prescribed are
Eureka Springs, 1880; Seven Pines, 1882; Pass Christian, 1890;
and Jackson, 1890. The principal purpose in each, except the
summer resort, was to exclude the transient negro voter.</p>

<p>During this period it was not unusual for the legislature to
provide that there should be a separate registration of municipal
voters. This was the case with Natchez, 1870; Columbus, 1884;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Senatobia, 1884; Macon, 1884; Yazoo City, 1884; Ellisville, 1884;
Bolton, 1886; Bay St. Louis, 1886; Brooksville, 1886; Fulton,
1886; Pass Christian, 1886; Scooba, 1886; Biloxi, 1888; Terry,
1888; Potts Camp, 1888; Tunica, 1888; Water Valley, 1888;
Rosedale, 1890; Clarksdale, 1890; Jackson, 1890; Durant, 1890
Indianola, 1890.</p>

<p>The prepayment of a municipal tax was in several instances
made a requisite qualification: This was the case as to a street
tax in Brookhaven, 1884; Greenville, 1884 and 1886; Vicksburg,
1886; Vaiden, 1886; and as to street tax and poll tax, Jackson,
1890; Durant, 1890.</p>

<p>In but one instance during the period, 1869 to 1890, do we
find the "householders and freeholders" made voters, the case of
Greenwood Springs, 1871, though, as we have seen, this was a
favorite idea in the early days of the state. In 1882 the spirit
of liberality was given full scope by the act providing that "all
persons residing within the town limits" should have the right
to vote in Columbia; again we will make the suggestion of a
skeptic and express doubt whether the girl babies exercised the
right.</p>


<h3>UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1890.</h3>

<p>The provisions of the new constitution of Mississippi on the
subject of suffrage are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">ARTICLE 12.</div>

<div class="center">FRANCHISE.</div>

<p>Section 240. All elections by the people shall be by ballot.</p>

<p>Section 241. Every male inhabitant of this state, except
idiots, insane persons, and Indians not taxed, who is a citizen of
the United States, twenty-one years old and upwards, who has
resided in this state two years, and one year in the election district,
or in the incorporated city or town in which he offers to
vote, and who is duly registered as provided in this article, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
who has never been convicted of bribery, burglary, theft, arson,
obtaining money or goods under false pretenses, perjury, forgery,
embezzlement, or bigamy, and who has paid, on or before
the first of February of the year in which he shall offer to vote,
all taxes which may have been legally required of him, and which
he has had an opportunity of paying according to law for the
two preceding years, and who shall produce to the officers holding
the election satisfactory evidence that he has paid said taxes,
is declared to be a qualified elector; but any minister of the gospel
in charge of an organized church shall be entitled to vote
after six months' residence in the election district, if otherwise
qualified.</p>

<p>Section 244. On and after the first day of January, A. D.
1892, every elector shall, in addition to the foregoing qualifications,
be able to read any section of the constitution of this state;
or he shall be able to understand the same when read to him, or
give a reasonable interpretation thereof. A new registration
shall be made before the next ensuing election after January the
first, A. D. 1892.</p>

<p>The qualifications at the present time, therefore, of an elector
are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Male,<br />
2. Inhabitant of the state, excluding idiots, insane persons
and Indians not taxed,<br />
3. Citizen of the United States,<br />
4. Twenty-one years old or upwards,<br />
5. Resident of the state for two years,<br />
6. Resident for one year in the election district, or city or
town, except ministers of the gospel who may vote on six months'
residence,<br />
7. Duly registered,<br />
8. Never convicted of bribery and other enumerated
crimes,<br />
9. Has paid two years' taxes,<br />
10. Able to read any section of the constitution of the state;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or able to understand the same when read to him, or give a reasonable
interpretation thereof.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It will be noted that these constitutional qualifications, unlike
the provisions of former fundamental laws, are by the section
above quoted made to apply to electors in municipal elections;
the legislature, however, is authorized to prescribe additional
qualifications. And it has prescribed as such additional
qualifications, by the section on that subject in the chapter of the
new Code on Municipalities, that the voter must have resided
within the corporate limits for one year next before he offers to
register and he must not be in default for taxes due the municipality
for the two preceding years.</p>

<p>Much has been said about this constitution, both for and
against it; especially has the "understanding clause," the tenth
qualification as enumerated above, been severely criticised. Thus
we find in the American Law Review of January-February,
1892, the following: "It is quite apparent that this clause was
never intended to be carried out faithfully. It will be so administered
as to exclude the negro voters, hardly one of whom
will be eligible under it, and so as not to exclude the ignorant
white voter. The last qualification, the ability to give a reasonable
interpretation of any clause of the constitution of the state,
would exclude nearly all the lawyers and judges in the state.
In this manner the people of Mississippi endeavor to solve the
appalling problem of carrying on civil government with a mass
of voters easily corrupted and so stolid and ignorant as not to
be able to understand the first principles of their political
institutions."</p>

<p>And we find in the Atlantic Monthly, December, 1892, the
following statement in reference to it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That it may, and probably will, be put into operation so as
to preclude the negro from voting, while his equally ignorant
white neighbor is allowed the privilege, appears from the fact
that the inability to read does not constitute an absolute basis of
exclusion; for the inspectors may allow a person to vote who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>can understand or give a reasonable interpretation of a section
of the constitution when read to him. It is apparent that an
inspector may very easily reject as unreasonable an interpretation
from a colored man, and accept one no whit better from a
white man. Such discrimination in practice would be very hard
to discover."</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mr. John F. Dillon, one of the most distinguished of
American lawyers, in his address as President of the American
Bar Association, at Saratoga, August, 1892, speaking of this
section of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has been supposed that this clause was a concession
made in the interest of illiterate whites; but whether this be so
or not, a general and indiscriminate requirement that all voters
shall be able to read and write is, in my judgment, not contrary
to the fundamental principles of American government, but in
accordance with the principles on which such government must
securely rest, namely, the intelligence and virtue of the people."</p></blockquote>

<p>I have heard attributed to a distinguished United States
Senator, who would have been glad to have come to a different
conclusion, that this constitution demonstrated that Anglo-Saxon
ingenuity could accomplish anything; that the provisions
of it on the subject of the suffrage was a practical repeal of the
fifteenth amendment of the constitution of the United States, and
yet the result was effected in such a way that its legality could
not be successfully denied.</p>

<p>The truth is, without reference to the designs of its authors,
that we have under it in the state, to all intents and purposes,
an educational qualification pure and simple. More negroes, the
American Law Review and the Atlantic Monthly to the contrary
notwithstanding, have registered under the alternate or
understanding clause than white men. Only 2,672 illiterate,
both white and black, had up to 1893 registered under it. I have
not seen the figures since. The negroes who have taken advantage
of it exceed the white men who have done so in a majority
of the counties of the state.</p>

<p>It seems that the illiterate white man shrinks from an application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to be registered under the "understanding clause;" a
refusal to advertise his incapacity, while the negroes as a rule
have but little to lose; but another truth is that with scarcely an
exception the negroes are thoroughly content with the constitution,
and are satisfied to be measured for registration and voting
by its standards. The writer, as a member of the convention
which adopted the constitution, voted against the "understanding
clause," but now that he has seen its practical workings he
is prepared to say that the convention did the very best thing
that it could have done under the circumstances surrounding it.</p>

<p>This "understanding clause" is not without a parallel in
the constitutions of other states; as was pointed out by Senator
George of this state in the United States Senate, it is no more
difficult of honest administration than are the provisions of the
constitutions of other states: for example, the constitution of
Vermont of 1777 provided that an elector "should be of quiet,
peaceable behavior," and the constitution of Connecticut requires
at this day that the voter shall sustain "a good moral
character," and numerous other like instances that might be
mentioned.</p>

<p>The constitutional provision that a person shall not register
as a voter within four months of an election is believed to be a
wise measure; the ignorant, the indifferent and the sordid voter
fails to register; political excitement never exists to any considerable
extent so long before the election; there is no such thing
as hiring men to register, for those who can be hired, cannot be
trusted for so long a time to vote in the promised or expected
way. It is believed that the provision is worthy of adoption
everywhere.</p>

<p>The legislation of Mississippi under the constitution of 1890
conforms to that instrument.</p>

<p>By sections 3624 to 3640 of the code (1892) ample provision
is made for appeals from adverse rulings of registration officers,
and the humblest citizen of the land, the humblest negro,
if you please, can invoke the courts of the country, even the
Supreme Court, for protection in case he be improperly denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the right to register and vote, and he is also provided with ample
remedy before the courts in every case where the right is
improperly granted to others. These Code sections are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3624. <i>Appeal by person denied registration.</i>&mdash;Any person denied
the right to register as a voter may appeal from the decision of the
registrar to the Board of election commissioners by filing with the registrar,
on the same day of such denial or within five days thereafter,
a written application for appeal.</p>

<p>3625. <i>Appeal by other than person denied.</i>&mdash;Any elector of the
county may likewise appeal from the decision of the registrar allowing
any other person to be registered as a voter; but before the same can
be heard the party appealing shall give notice to the person whose
registration is appealed from, in writing, stating the grounds of the
appeal; which notice shall be served by the sheriff or constable, as
process in other courts is required to be served; and the officer may
demand and receive for such service, from the person requesting the
same the sum of one dollar.</p>

<p>3626. <i>Appeal heard de novo.</i>&mdash;All cases on appeals shall be heard
by the boards of election commissioners de novo, and oral evidence
may be heard by them; and they are authorized to administer oaths to
witnesses before them; and they have the power to subp&oelig;na witnesses,
and to compel their attendance; to send for persons and papers; to require
the sheriff and constables to attend them and execute their process.
The decisions of the commissioners in all cases shall be final as
to questions of fact, but as to matters of law they may be revised by
the circuit and supreme courts. The registrar shall obey the orders
of the commissioners in directing a person to be registered, or a name
to be stricken from the registration books.</p>

<p>3637. <i>Appeal from the decision of the Commissioners.</i>&mdash;Any elector
aggrieved by the decision of the commissioners, shall have the right
to file a bill of exceptions thereto, to be approved and signed by the
commissioners, embodying the evidence in the case and the findings
of the commissioners, within two days after the rendition of the decision,
and may thereupon appeal to the circuit court upon the execution
of a bond, with two or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by the
commissioners, in the sum of one hundred dollars, payable to the state,
and conditioned to pay all costs in case the appeal shall not be successfully
prosecuted; and in case the decision of the commissioners be
affirmed, judgment shall be entered on the bond for all costs.</p>

<p>3638. <i>Duty of Commissioners in case of appeal to Circuit Court.</i>&mdash;It
shall be the duty of the commissioners, in case of appeal from their
decision, to return the bill of exceptions and the appeal bond into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>circuit court of the county within five days after the filing of the same
with them; and the circuit courts shall have jurisdiction to hear and
determine such appeals.</p>

<p>3629. <i>Proceedings in the Circuit Court.</i>&mdash;Should the judgment of
the circuit court be in favor of the right of an elector to be registered,
the court shall so order, and shall, by its judgment, direct the registrar
of the county forthwith to register him. Costs shall not, in any
case, be adjudged the commissioners or the registrar.</p>

<p>3630. <i>Costs; compensation, etc.</i>&mdash;The election commissioners shall
not award costs in proceedings before them; but the circuit and supreme
courts shall allow costs, as in other cases. The sheriffs, when
required to attend before the commissioners at their meetings, shall be
paid two dollars a day, to be allowed by the board of supervisors.</p></blockquote>

<p>Having now considered and presented the evolution of suffrage
in this state and given by way of recital and incidentally
at least, its present status, we come to consider the objects upon
which the suffrage may be exercised, and this can be easily stated
by the general averment that all legislative and executive officers
are elected by the suffragists; the executive officers of the
state are not elected necessarily by a plurality or a majority vote.
We have a sort of an electoral scheme, which is created by the
constitution in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 140.</span>&mdash;The governor of the state shall be chosen in the
following manner: On the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November
of <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1895, and on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of
November in every fourth year thereafter, until the day shall be
changed by law, an election shall be held in the several counties and
districts created for the election of members of the house of representatives
in this state, for governor, and the person receiving in any county
or such legislative district the highest number of votes cast therein, for
said office, shall be holden to have received as many votes as such
county or district is entitled to members in the house of representatives
which last named votes are hereby designated "electoral votes." In
all cases where a representative is apportioned to two or more counties
or districts, the electoral vote, based on such representative, shall be
equally divided among such counties or districts. The returns of said
election shall be certified by the election commissioners, or a majority
of them, of the several counties, and transmitted, sealed, to the seat of
government, directed to the secretary of state, and shall be by him
safely kept and delivered to the speaker of the house of representatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>at the next ensuing session of the legislature within one day
after he shall have been elected. The speaker, shall on the next Tuesday
after he shall have received said returns, open and publish them
in the presence of the house of representatives, and said house shall
ascertain and count the vote of each county and legislative district and
decide any contest that may be made concerning the same, and said
decision shall be made by a majority of the whole number of members
of the house of representatives concurring therein, by a viva voce vote,
which shall be recorded in its journal; <i>Provided</i>, In case the two highest
candidates have an equal number of votes in any county or legislative
district, the electoral vote of such county or legislative district
shall be considered as equally divided between them. The person
found to have received a majority of all the elective votes, and also a
majority of the popular vote, shall be declared elected.</p>

<p>Section 141. If no person shall receive such majorities, then the
house of representatives shall proceed to choose a governor from the
two persons who shall have received the highest number of popular
votes. The election shall be by viva voce, which shall be recorded in
the journal, in such manner as to show for whom each member voted.</p>

<p>Section 142. In case of an election of governor or any state officer
by the house of representatives, no member of that house shall be eligible
to receive any appointment from the governor or other state officer
so elected during the term for which he shall be elected.</p>

<p>Section 143. All other state officers shall be elected at the same
time and in the same manner as provided for election of governor.</p></blockquote>

<p>The legislature is prohibited from electing officers to a very
great extent by the following section of the constitution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Section 99. The legislature shall not elect any other than its own
officers, state librarian and United States Senators; but this section
shall not prohibit the legislature from appointing presidential electors.</p></blockquote>

<p>All the judges of the state, except justices of the peace, are
appointed by the Governor by and with the advice and consent
of the senate. Mississippi was, it may be mentioned parenthetically,
the first state to provide for an elective judiciary; this
was done in her constitution of 1832; but she is now as far away
from that mode of selection as she can well be, her present constitution
providing for their appointment and her people generally,
it is believed, are thoroughly satisfied with the present
status of the matter. There are two instances in which the electors
vote directly upon the subject of the enforcement of laws;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and without an affirmative vote in their favor the statutes are
not enforced. These are, first the Local Option law, by which the
qualified electors of a county, if a majority vote against the sale,
may prohibit the licensing of dram-shops in the county, and under
which a large majority of the counties of the state have secured
absolute statutory prohibition of the liquor traffic; and,
second, the fence and stock law, by which is determined the question
of whether the owners of live stock shall keep them confined,
and thus allow of the production of crops on unenclosed
lands. This resolves itself into a question of "fences" or "no
fences," and it is left to a vote in the counties, or parts of counties
can vote upon it. This question is left to "the resident freeholders
and leaseholders for a term of three years or more" of
the territory so voting. It will be noticed that neither sex nor
age is mentioned, and in truth women and infants do actually
vote in the state, on this interesting and to those involved, most
serious question.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of the state has settled beyond cavil
that the statute is constitutional and valid. This "fence" or
"no fence" election is possibly an exception to the general rule
of the state that a plurality vote elects or carries. I say, possibly
is an exception, because of ambiguity in the statute, construed
as I think it may be seen by some minds, it will require
two thirds of the vote cast to put the "no fence" law in force.</p>

<p>All elections in Mississippi since 1821 have been by ballot,
and this is now the constitutional rule; we have here the Australian
or secret ballot system very much as it is found in a number
of states of the Union, and it accomplishes in its practical operation
the primary objects of the system; first, the absolute prevention
of bribery, for no man will bribe a voter if the only evidence
of the delivery of the contracted-for vote be the word of
the bribe taker, and, second, the prevention of intimidation of
voters, which is practically impossible.</p>

<p>The absence from the voting place since the introduction of
the system of the ticket broker and professional bummer is
notable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the intention of the writer when this article was begun
to present his views on many of the questions suggested and
germain to the general subject, but this paper has now grown so
long that he will have to be content with a presentation of a mere
historical narrative of matters pertaining to suffrage in this
state. He consoles himself with the reflection that perhaps such
a contribution may be more valuable to the true and earnest
student of the subject than would be any discourse that he might
write which in its nature was sought to be made philosophical, or
which was merely speculative. If the facts are presented, if the
history be made accessible, the student who is interested enough
to read will draw the proper conclusions.</p>

<h2>SPANISH POLICY IN MISSISSIPPI AFTER THE TREATY OF SAN LORENZO.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">By Franklin L. Riley, Ph. D.</span></div>


<p>October 16, 1795,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Thomas Pinckney, in behalf of the United
States and the Prince of Peace, representing His Catholic Majesty,
signed at San Lorenzo el Real, a treaty which contained
among other things, the following stipulations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The southern boundary of the United States, which divides their
territory from the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida, shall be
designated by a line beginning on the River Mississippi at the northernmost
part of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the equator,
which from thence shall be drawn due east to the River Apalachicola,"
etc.</p>

<p>"If there should be any troops, garrisons or settlements of either
party in the territory of the other according to the above-mentioned
boundaries, they shall be withdrawn from the said territory within the
term of six months after the ratification of this treaty, or sooner if
possible."</p>

<p>"One Commissioner and one Surveyor shall be appointed by each of
the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natchez on the left side
of the River Mississippi before the expiration of six months from the
ratification of this convention and they shall proceed to run and mark
this boundary according to the stipulations."</p>

<p>"The navigation of the said (Mississippi) River, in its whole
breadth from its source to the ocean shall be free only to his (Catholic
Majesty) subjects and the citizens of the United States, unless he
should extend this privilege to the subjects of other Powers by special
convention."</p>

<p>"The two high contracting parties shall____maintain peace and
harmony among the several Indian nations who inhabit the country
adjacent to____the boundaries of the two Floridas." "No treaty of
alliance or other whatever (except treaties of peace) shall be made by
either party with the Indians living within the boundary of the other."</p></blockquote>

<p>These terms, so favorable to the United States and so destructive
of Spanish interests, had long been the rock upon
which all plans for an adjustment of the differences between the
two powers had been stranded.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Nor were they finally extorted
from Spain until a concurrence of unfavorable events had precipitated
a diplomatic crisis. Even then his Catholic Majesty
seemed to consider such stipulations as only a temporary expedient,
the fulfillment of which he hoped eventually to be able to
evade. The Prince of Peace himself admits that political circumstances
forced Spain to consent to the treaty and intimates
further that he would have made even greater concessions if they
had been demanded by the United States. In writing of these
negotiations, he says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"I had taken to heart the treaty (Jay's), which unknown to us the
English cabinet had negotiated with the United States of America; this
treaty afforded great latitude to evil designs; it was possible to injure
Spain in an indirect manner and without risk, in her distant possessions.</p>

<p>"I endeavored to conclude another treaty with the same states, and
had the satisfaction to succeed in my object; <i>I obtained unexpected advantages</i>,
and met with sympathy, loyalty, and generous sentiments in
that nation of Republicans."</p></blockquote>

<p>Subsequent events proved, however, that Godoy had overestimated
the probabilities of a consolidation of interests between
the United States and Great Britain, and that Spain had
also failed to gain that ascendency over the affairs of this "nation
of republicans," which she hoped to do through this treaty.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
She was therefore no longer interested in fulfilling its stipulations.
These facts are substantiated by a letter which
Stoddard<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> claims was written by Governor Gayoso in June, 1796, to
a confidential friend, and which came to light several years afterward.
In this communication Gayoso claims that:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The object of Great Britain in her treaty with the United States
about this period, was to attach them to her interests, and even render
them dependent on her, and, therefore, the Spanish treaty of limits
was made to counterbalance it; but as Great Britain had totally failed
in her object it was not the policy of Spain to regard her stipulations."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In order to evade the treaty, she now returned to a line
of policy which she had adopted several years previous<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
which had also been tried by more than one foreign power<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
since the combined efforts of England, France and Spain to
"coop up" the United States between the Alleghanies and the
Atlantic, at the close of the Revolutionary War.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This was
nothing less than a dismemberment of the United States. But
the accomplishment of this bold project required time. She,
therefore, resorted to her historic policy of procrastination, hoping
ultimately to evade the treaty and thus regain what had been
wrested from her in diplomacy. She was fully aware of the
dissatisfaction the western states had expressed over the tardiness
and at times the apparent indifference of the United States
to the navigation of the Mississippi<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and she also realized that
the publication of the treaty "would bring her project of dismemberment
to a crisis and in a manner to compel the western
people to make a decided election to adhere to the Atlantic states
or to embrace the splendid advantages held out to them on the
Mississippi."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Hence, upon the announcement of the treaty in
New Orleans, a Spanish emissary was immediately dispatched
from that place to Tennessee and Kentucky, with authority to
engage the services of the principal inhabitants in a scheme to
disaffect the people towards the United States by the free use of
money and promises of independence and free trade.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In Gayoso's
letter of June, 1796, referred to above, the assertion was
made that,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"It was expected that several states would separate from the union,
which would absolve Spain from her engagements; because, as her
contract was made with the union, it would be no longer obligatory
than while the union lasted. That Spain, contrary to her expectations,
was not likely to derive any advantages from the treaty, and that her
views and policy would be changed, particularly if an alteration took
place in the political existence of the United States. He therefore concluded,
that all things considered, nothing more would result from the
treaty than the free navigation of the Mississippi."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A second line of policy for evading the treaty was then
opened up. This was to postpone an execution of its stipulations
awaiting the development of certain international complications
which seemed to be inevitable. There had been a rupture
in the diplomatic relation of the United States and France
and hostilities between these two countries seemed to be near at
hand. Mr. Pickering, who was Secretary of State from 1795 to
1800, considered this the real cause for delay on the part of
Spain, after contending that the other reasons given by the
Spanish authorities were "merely ostensible," he says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The true reason is doubtless developed by the Baron (de Corondelet)<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
in his proclamation of the 31st of May (1797). <i>The expectation
of an immediate rupture between France, the intimate ally of Spain,
and the United States.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>By making common cause with France, in case of such a
rupture, Spain evidently thought that she could recover some of
the concessions she had made in the treaty, if compliance with
its stipulations should not be too far effected.</p>

<p>In order to find time for the operation of these schemes, the
Spanish officials produced, from time to time, such excuses as
either the treaty or the circumstances rendered plausible. After
months of fruitless delay, they determined to rest their final action
upon the results of another effort to detach the western
states from the Union. An emissary was again sent to Tennessee
and Kentucky to confer with certain men who were former correspondents
of the governors of Louisiana. He found, however,
that the people were less disposed towards a change than they
were ten years previous, especially since they were likely to
secure the navigation of the Mississippi,&mdash;the real cause of their
former disaffection&mdash;without resorting to a hazardous enterprise.
After an eventful sojourn in this region, he returned to
New Orleans in January, 1798, bearing the unwelcome report
which convinced the Governor General that Spain had lost all
hope of political prestige in the territory north of the 31st degree
and east of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Arrangements were then perfected
for the execution of the treaty.</p>

<p>In the light of the Spanish policy as presented above,
local events may be easily interpreted. As time was an indispensable
condition upon which the success of this policy depended,
it was gained by various pretexts. Don Yrujo, the Spanish
minister, intrigued at Philadelphia, and his efforts were ably
seconded by Carondelet, Gayoso<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and a host of subordinate officials
on the Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with a stipulation of the treaty, President
Washington appointed the Honorable Andrew Ellicott<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as Commissioner
to run the boundary line in behalf of the United
States. He left Philadelphia for Natchez by way of the Ohio
and the Mississippi, September 16, 1796. But his descent of
the Mississippi had been anticipated by the Spaniards, who had
prepared obstructive measures in advance of his coming. So
that whenever he came in contact with Spanish officials they
evinced a disposition to hinder his descent of the river, if not
prevent it altogether.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Some of them affected ignorance of the
treaty, others appeared embarrassed at the presence of the
Americans, while none of them had made or were making, so
far as the Commissioner could observe, any preparations to evacuate
the posts according to the terms of the treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Before reaching his destination, Ellicott received a communication
from Governor Gayoso, expressing his gratification
at the arrival of the Commissioner in those waters and requesting
that the military escort accompanying him should be left at
the mouth of the Bayou Pierre, sixty miles above Natchez, in
order to prevent an "unforeseen misunderstanding" between
the troops of the two nations. Since the treaty had provided
for such an escort, this request was deemed improper by Ellicott.
He yielded the point, however, for the time being, out of deference
to the wishes of the Governor.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Upon his arrival at Natchez, February 24, 1797, ten months
after the ratification of the treaty, he found no one ready to
co-operate with him in the performance of the duty assigned.
To the contrary, he learned through private sources that the
Baron de Carondelet, the Governor General of Louisiana, had
declared that the treaty was never intended to be carried into
effect, that as Commissioner on the part of Spain, he would
evade or delay from one pretense or another, the running of the
boundary line until the treaty would become "a dead letter,"
and that Louisiana either had been, or would soon be ceded to
France.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>About this time a suggestive and characteristic event occurred
which gives an insight into the temper of both the Spanish
Governor and the American Commissioner. About two
hours after the flag of the United States had been hoisted over
the Commissioner's camp, Gayoso requested that it be lowered.
This request met with a flat refusal, and though there were
rumors of parties being formed to cut it down, "the flag wore
out upon the staff."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Gayoso explained, a fortnight later, that
his objection to the flag was not prompted by a desire to show a
discourtesy to the United States, but to prevent any unbecoming
conduct on the part of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This explanation, however,
seems to have been an after-thought. Suffice it to say,
when it was offered the Indians had become so troublesome that
Ellicott had determined to send for his escort. The Governor,
after declaring that he would construe their descent as an insult
to his master,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and then suggesting that they might with
propriety join the Commissioner at Loftus Cliffs, near Clarksville,
finally consented that they go into camp at Bacon's Landing,
a few miles below town.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This put an end to the efforts of
the Spaniards to draw Ellicott away from Natchez, the place
designated by the treaty for the meeting of the commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>After the lapse of a fortnight from the time of his arrival,
Ellicott was informed that the Spanish Commissioner, the Baron
de Carondelet, was detained in New Orleans in the discharge of
duties incident to the war then waging between Spain and Great
Britain, and that in his absence the business of the survey would
devolve upon Governor Gayoso.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> March 19, had been settled
upon as the time when the commissioners would begin operation,
but with this change of commissioner, Gayoso gave notice that
it would be impossible to proceed at the time appointed. He
promised, however, to be ready at an early day. But, before
these preparations were perfected, Spanish finesse had discovered
a new reason for delay. This in turn was followed by
others until May 11, when Ellicott was finally informed that
the business upon which he had come was postponed indefinitely,
awaiting further orders from the ministers of the two powers
concerned.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> These pretexts having varied from time to time, it
would be well to present them in one view.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>


<h3>I. NECESSITY OF AWAITING THE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS FOR
SECURING THE INHABITANTS IN THE POSSESSION OF THEIR LANDS.</h3>

<p>This reason was first given in a proclamation issued by
Governor Gayoso on the 28th of March, 1797, but bearing the
Gate of the day following. It was reiterated in a second proclamation
of the same date. Yet, when the Secretary of State, two
and a half months later, received from Commissioner Ellicott a
notice of this reason for delay, he declared that no such negotiation
had existed and that it was the first time these objections
to the evacuation of the posts had been heard of.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Two months
later still he observed that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As____the great body of the inhabitants (of the territory) appear
not to desire the patronage of the Spanish Government to secure it
(their real estate); as the Government of the United States must be at
least as anxious as that of Spain to protect the inhabitants in their
rights when (they) become citizens of the United States ... there can be
no difficulty in deciding whether this is a reason or a pretense. Besides,
the negotiation ... has never existed; nor even been proposed
or hinted either to or by the Government of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Orders were promptly issued, however, by the President
and the Secretary of War to assure Governor Gayoso that no
person would be "disturbed in his possession or property, till
an opportunity had been afforded to apply to Congress," and
that they might "rely upon their claims being adjusted upon the
most equitable principles."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>


<h3>II, DESIRE OF FIRST ESTABLISHING FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE INDIANS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE TERRITORY
TO BE CEDED<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</h3>

<p>On this subject Gayoso asserted that it was "impossible for
His Catholic Majesty to leave unprotected so many of his faithful
subjects and expose other settlements to the revengeful disposition
of discontented Indians." He therefore felt justified
in retaining possession of the country until he might be sure
the savages would be pacific.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The Secretary of State contended
that such a reason would warrant the assertion, that
"the Governor meant, for an indefinite period to avoid an evacuation
of the posts: for, while a tribe of Indians existed in that
quarter, the Governor could not be <i>sure</i> that they would be pacific."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
He observed further, that,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Upon a view of the whole correspondence ... submitted to the
President, it appears that there is but too much reason to believe
... that an undue influence has been exercised over the Indians by the
officers of His Catholic Majesty to prepare them for a rupture with the
United States, those suspicions corresponding with other intelligence
recently received by the Secretary of War and by me."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Instructions were issued by the Secretary of War to assure
the Spanish Commandant that effort would be made "to
preserve a continuance of the pacific dispositions of the Indians
within our limits, towards the subjects of His Catholic Majesty
or his Indians; and to prevent their commencing hostilities (of
which there is no appearance) against either."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<h3>III. NECESSITY OF CONSULTING THE KING CONCERNING THE CONDITION
IN WHICH THE FORTS WERE TO BE
SURRENDERED.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h3>

<p>The treaty failed to specify whether the posts should be
surrendered with the buildings and fortifications intact, or
whether they should first be dismantled. Gayoso declared that
a treaty with the Indians required a demolition of the post
at Walnut Hill and that orders had been issued to that effect,
but that owing to their unsettled dispositions he had received
counter orders to prevent the fortifications from being injured.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
General Wayne took the position that the posts should be left
standing.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> President Adams, however, left the matter entirely
to the discretion of the Spanish officials, and thus at once
brought an end to the validity of this excuse.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> On this sub-Secretary
Pickering maintained:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"It is probably the first time that to 'withdraw,' or retire from a
place, has been imagined to intend its destruction. If, at the formation
of the treaty, the demolition of the posts had been intended, it would
assuredly have been expressed."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When the Spaniards had really decided to surrender the
district, no further mention was made of this subject, showing
that, notwithstanding their treaty with the Indians, they considered
the demolition of the forts of no consequence whatever.</p>


<h3>IV. EXPECTATION OF AN ATTACK UPON LOUISIANA BY A BRITISH
FORCE FROM CANADA.</h3>

<p>Suspicion to this effect, though based upon reports more
or less vague, had been expressed by the Spanish Minister as
early as the February preceding; and had been reiterated by
him from time to time,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> until at the expiration of three months,
it had developed into a pretext for delaying the execution of
the treaty. In fact, the Baron de Carondelet asserted in a
proclamation of May 24, that further delay in surveying the
boundary line and in evacuating the forts was then occasioned
only by the imperious necessity of securing Lower Louisiana,
in case the British should become masters of the Illinois country<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and that such apprehensions had caused him to put the
post at Walnut Hills "in a respectable but provisional state
of defence."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Secretary Pickering not only considered these
suspicions groundless, but contended further that,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"If the posts of the Natchez and Walnut Hills 'are the only bulwarks
of Lower Louisiana, to stop the course of the British,' as the
Baron alerts and if, therefore, Spain is justifiable in holding them,
she may retain them, without any limitation of time, for her security in
any future war, as well as in that which now exists."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Before the appearance of the Baron's proclamation containing
this reason for delay, the Spanish Minister had been
informed that the Secretary of State saw no reasons for such
suspicions and the British Minister had been notified that the
Government of the United States would suffer neither British
nor Spanish troops to march through its territory for the purpose
of hostility of one against the other.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Spanish Minister
replied<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, however, that he knew to a certainty that the
English had made a proposition to General Clarke of Georgia in
order to secure his influence in that State in a proposed attack
against Florida. At the request of Mr. Pickering, this report
was investigated by the District Attorney of Georgia. He replied
that he could not find any one who knew of the matter or
who entertained a belief of the report; and that from General
Clark's known violent antipathies to the English and other
circumstances, he doubted the truthfulness of it altogether.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>When the attention of Mr. Liston, the British Minister,
was directed to the subject, he pointedly denied that his government
either had intended or was then intending to invade
Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> A few days later, however, he admitted that a plan
for attacking the Floridas and other Spanish possessions adjoining
the United States had been submitted to him by other persons,
whom he declined to name, but stated it was discountenanced
by him because its success depended upon a violation of
the neutrality of the United States and an enlistment of the
Indians. According to this plan, the expedition was to be undertaken
by a British sea force, which would be joined by such
volunteers of the United States as would join the king's standard
when raised on Spanish soil.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The noted conspiracy of Senator Blount of Tennessee then
came to light<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and precipitated a spirited discussion between
the Spanish Minister and Mr. Pickering. The former contended
that the plot had been revealed and that no one any longer
doubted that the expedition was to have taken place,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> while the
latter maintained that there could have been no connection between
Blount's scheme and either the expedition from Canada,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
or the project attributed to General Clarke.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The Secretary
argued in support of his position that Blount's expedition was
to have been formed in one of the states south of the River Ohio;
that it was destined against the Floridas, and perhaps Lower
Louisiana; that Blount himself expected to be at the head of
it; that it was not to be undertaken but in conjunction with a
British force; and that "on the proposal of the expedition to
the British Government, it was totally rejected."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He maintained
further that the suspicion of a British invasion from
Canada was groundless for the following reasons:&mdash;(1) Preparations
for such an expedition would have attracted attention
and rendered satisfactory proofs attainable; (2) the troops of
the United States, stationed along the Canadian border, were in
position to protect the frontier, as well as to get information of
any warlike preparations and communicate the same to the
Secretary of War, yet no such communications had been made;
(3) the British did not have on the lakes a force adequate to
such an enterprise; (4) the routes suggested for such a campaign
would have interposed great difficulties for the transportation
of troops, equipage, provisions, etc., even if they could
have been taken without violating the territory of the United
States; and (5) the British Minister, after inquiring of the
Governor General of Canada and of "the British Secretary of
State," denied that his Government either had intended or was
then intending such an expedition.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3>V. FEAR OF AN ATTACK FROM THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>In the Spring of 1797, certain American troops were sent
from the Ohio into Tennessee for the purpose of preventing a
forced settlement upon the Cherokee lands. Orders were also
given the Cumberland militia to hold itself in readiness to prevent
similar encroachments.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> These facts were seized upon by
Carondelet, who asserted in a proclamation of May 31, that
since the United States was at peace with all the savages, these
movements must concern the Spanish provinces. To make this
pretext more plausible, the proclamation also made mention
of "the anterior menaces" of the representatives of the United
States at Natchez;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of the expected rupture between that Power
and France, the intimate ally of Spain; and of the recognition
by the United States of the right of England to navigate the
Mississippi, which, the Baron adds, "appears to annul" the
treaty with His Catholic Majesty, by which the United States
acknowledged that "no other nation can navigate upon the
Mississippi without the consent of Spain."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Secretary Pickering regarded the expectation of a rupture
between the United States and France as the real cause
of the delay in running the boundary and in evacuating the
posts.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> With reference to any hostile intentions on the part of
the United States, he wrote,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Never, perhaps, was conceived a more absurd idea, than that of
marching troops from the Ohio to the State of Tennessee, and thence to
the Natchez, in the whole a tedious, difficult and expensive route of
many hundred miles, chiefly through a wilderness; when, if the United
States had any hostile views, they had only to collect their troops to the
Ohio, and suffer them to be floated down that river and the Mississippi,
almost without labor, with great expedition, and at small expense,
to the county to be attacked."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These pretexts were usually accompanied by a profusion
of promises and explanations which rendered them more or
less plausible. Besides this, the Spaniards on more than one
occasion made appearances of beginning the evacuation.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Although
declaring that nothing could prevent the religious fulfilment
of the treaty, they were, at the same time, strengthening
their fortifications and augmenting their forces on the river.
Under such circumstances, the presence of American soldiers
and officers was not desired. This fact explains the efforts of
Governor Gayoso to prevent Ellicott's escort from reaching
Natchez and the attempts to entice the Commissioner himself
away from that place.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>He had scarcely failed in these schemes, however, when
he heard of the descent of Lieutenant Pope with a small detachment
of American troops to take charge of the posts upon
their evacuation. He then sent Ellicott an open letter directed
to Pope, in which it was stated that "for sundry reasons it
would be proper and conduce to the harmony of the two nations"
for these troops to remain at a distance until the posts
were evacuated, which would be completed in a few days. But
instead of complying with the Governor's request to second this
effort at harmony, Ellicott wrote to Pope that there was evidence
to show that an evacuation was not really intended in any reasonable
time and that in his opinion the sooner the American
troops reached Natchez the better.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Upon receiving the Governor's
letter Pope stopped his detachment at the Walnut Hills.
April 17, Ellicott wrote a second letter stating that a rupture
with the Spanish authorities at Natchez was near at hand and
that in his opinion the Lieutenant could better serve his country
at Natchez than at any other point on the river.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In response to
this letter, Pope and his command resumed their descent, the
Governor finally consenting, and reached Natchez April 24,
1797.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the general outlines of the contest that was waged
between the representatives of the two powers over the dilatory
policy of Spain. Subsequent diplomatic discussion centered on
the navigation of the Mississippi and the affairs at Natchez assumed
the form of a popular outbreak against the established
government in the district.</p>

<h2>TIME AND PLACE RELATIONS IN HISTORY, WITH
SOME LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI
APPLICATIONS</h2>

<div class="center">PROF. H. E. CHAMBERS.</div>


<p>A student or writer of history, imbued with the true and
scientific spirit of historical research and expression, would
hesitate to accept the task of compiling the narrative of a State
or country if it were required of him to confine himself strictly
to local events. He would, indeed, find it difficult to isolate
the facts bearing upon the State or country from their antecedents,
distant in time and space, or from their consequents
when communicated to contemporaneous and succeeding communities,
or social organizations.</p>

<p>The great stream of human affairs is a tide of many currents.
He who would pilot by his pen the reading multitude
must note the crossings and the blendings, the counter-runnings
and the parallelings. He cannot take an arbitrary stand and say
that this tide of affairs began in this place and ended in that;
or that this course of events began in such a year and ended in
such another. Back of every motion is an impelling power.
Back of every individual action lies the basic principles of human
conduct. Back of every manifestation of corporate activity
may be found a pulsive social force. Neither individual
nor social movement can be studied understandingly alone.
Each forms a link in a chain whose beginning and end may not
be clearly seen, but whose continuity may be inferred from upholding
and depending contiguous links.</p>

<p>This continuity when once perceived enables us to bring
into relation widely associated ideas. For instance, the history
of Oregon, through the first English explorer of its shores, leads
us to the point where the intense vitality of the English nation
was first directed to securing the naval supremacy of the world.
The history of any one of our north-central States introduces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
us to the follies, fashions, and ambitions of the French Court
under several Louises; to a long series of moves in one of the
most complicated games ever played upon the chess-board of
European politics; and to the most critical period in American
affairs when Virginia by generously renouncing an empire appeased
discordant and jealous elements and made possible the
formation of the Federal Union. Patrick Henry's passionate
plea for liberty was but the echo of the clarion call which rang
over Runnymede centuries before, and this call was but the
voicing of an idea which dominated the most primitive of Teutonic
peoples in the remotest past. And so I might make innumerable
citations to show that the present is but the heir to
the past; and that what is, stands in close relation to what has
been.</p>

<p>If time relations may be demonstrated by the association of
remotely associated ideas, or by tracing modern institutional
fruitage to their root points buried in the soil of the past, then
may other correlations be as easily established.</p>

<p>The idea of place as a background to historic treatment
has, to a certain extent, undergone change. The former conception
has been that of a region with artificial bounds established
by accident, treaty, or legislative enactment. The more modern
conception is that of a physiographic area whose limits nature
herself has fixed and within whose confines fundamental ethnic
ideas crystalized into institutional, social, political, and religious
forms have reached or are reaching complete or incomplete
expression.</p>

<p>Every great civilization that has ever arisen is or has been
a composite civilization. Isolate an individual, a community, a
people, or a race and no matter how favorable may be the circumstances
and environment, the advance made will only be so
far and no further, the final point of which advance is characterized
by rigidity of thought, fixity of forms, and slavish repetition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of actions. The greater Chinese Wall of non-intercourse
encircling the Mongolian nation for centuries cast the civilization
of the Flowery Kingdom into molds of monotony whose
stiffness has yielded only to the breaking of Occidental hammers
upon Chinese commercial portals.</p>

<p>The autocthonous civilization of Peru and Mexico hardly
attained the dignity of semi-barbarism. What might the Inca
or Aztec have become had the influx of European culture-impulses
reached his mind before its plasticity was lost, or had
the gifts of acquired experience and knowledge been brought to
him by hands guiltless of his scourging and innocent of his
blood?</p>

<p>On the other hand, let an individual mingle with his fellows;
a race or community enters into political or commercial
relation with its neighbors, the divine sparks struck off by the
attrition of mind with mind kindle the fires which illumine the
spiritual in man and sets in motion the machinery of human
progress. What student of history fails to recognize the influence
of Phoenician letters and Egyptian thought upon Greek
civilization; of Greek literature and ideals upon Roman character
and development; of Roman genius for organization and
talent for legal forms upon modern enlightened nations; of
whatever was best in the past upon whatever is best in the life
and thought and aspirations of the present.</p>

<p>Egypt began to advance when caravans first made their way
to her over heated outlying deserts, for these brought to her
something more than myrrh and incense, and precious fabrics.
Greece developed with phenomenal rapidity as soon as her galleys
sprinkled the blue waters of the Mediterranean, for with
every incoming freight came a whisper of rudimentary art or
culture which she forthwith clothed in beautiful form and language.
England was provincial and primitive until her commercial
supremacy made her the bearer of civilization to every
corner of the globe. She has received more than she has given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Look where we will, we see unmistakably the effects of action
and reaction in the intercourse of nations and communities.</p>

<p>In taking up the history of any one state of the Union, then,
we find it impossible to confine our observation to accidental or
unrelated happenings, however these happenings may find careful
chroniclings at the hands of local scribes and unphilosophic
writers. We see the States as a part of a physiographic area
having in common with other parts the determinative elements
of soil and climate which by prescribing industries, affect desires,
ambitions, thought, and other forms of human activity.
We study community forces and estimate their quality and intensity
as they find expression in characteristic social and political
institutions. We consider the people in their racial attitude,
anticipate similar results from similar motives as conforming
to the spirit and experience of the ethnic type to which
the majority of the people stand related. We regard the State
as an organic whole, a corporate being related to other similarly
constituted beings. Take what position we will, there come into
our line of vision ideas, origins, effects, reactions, and relations
which show us that a State's history extends indefinitely into
the past and in the present ramifies to every part of the larger,
body-politic of which it is a constituent member.</p>

<p>Apart from general principles there is a singular correlation
between the history of this your State and the history of
the one I so inadequately represent upon this occasion (First
Annual Mid-Winter Meeting of the Mississippi State Historical
Society). Both States were originally a part of that great continental
heart of North America, that wilderness of empire-like
extent, contended for by mighty nations in epoch-making struggles.
Both owe their initial territorial organization to the commercial
needs of the American people of a hundred years ago.
Up to a certain point the history of the one is but the history of
the other. The first settlement, paradoxical as it may seem, in
Louisiana was made in Mississippi. De Soto crossed your State
and died in ours. The same people who founded our city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
New Orleans established your city of Natchez. The narratives
of Bienville and Iberville are as closely associated with your history
as they are with ours. The two principal Indian wars
waged by the Louisiana colony were fought upon Mississippi
soil. The first appointed governor of the Mississippi Territory
was the first appointed governor of the Louisiana Territory.
When under Spanish rule that portion of our domain known as
the Florida parishes revolted, it was Reuben Kemper from your
territory that rallied to the support of the revolutionists and
struck such terror in the Spaniard's breast that Governor Folch
of Mobile piteously appealed to the United States Government
for protection. When the West Florida revolution was crowned
with success and an addition of new territory to the United
States resulted, Mississippi received her portion as well as Louisiana.
When in the days of the American Revolution the notorious
Willing came down from Philadelphia, ostensibly to
protect but really to rob, our district of Baton Rouge felt his
vulture clutch as keenly as did your district of Natchez. In
later times, when our Zachary Taylor found himself upon the
border lands of Mexico, an overwhelming foe in his front and
war hardly yet declared, your riflemen under Jefferson Davis
joined our Louisianian in rushing to his assistance, long before
the general government moved to protect its own. We followed
you out of the Union. Disaster to you was calamity to us. The
cause of the Confederacy we shared in common. Our dead are
sleeping together upon the old battlefields in every part of our
Southland. We are common sharers of the heritage of brave
deeds and undying memories. Your peerless citizen, the first
and only president of the Confederate States, died in our arms
and we gave him such sepulture that the continent trembled
under the all-powerful force of sentiment. We have faced your
dangers, felt your needs as only a people can whose interests
are one with yours. The spirit that framed your present constitution
is pulsing in our veins. And so, did the time limits of
this paper permit, might I continue to enumerate indefinitely
the instances in which History wipes out the boundary line by
which maps unblushingly infer that we are two peoples, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
separate interests and lines of thoughts. True history is broadening;
never narrowing. It is because so much of Louisiana
history is Mississippi history, and so much of Mississippi history
is in the chronicles of Louisiana that the narrative of either
State calls for so broad and liberal and inspiring a treatment
at the hands of the historian.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STUDY_AND_TEACHING_OF_HISTORY" id="THE_STUDY_AND_TEACHING_OF_HISTORY">THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF HISTORY.</a></h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">By Herbert B. Adams, Ph.D.</span></div>

<div class="center">Professor of History in the Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore.</div>


<p>Among all the subjects of college study and college teaching,
among all the means of liberal education fitting young men for
civic life and public duty not one stands higher than the study
and teaching of History.</p>

<p>In my senior year at Amherst College, President Julius H.
Seelye gave my class a single lecture on the Philosophy of History.
Among other good things he said: "History is the grandest
study in the world." That remark made the profoundest
impression upon my student imagination. I said to myself, "If
History is the grandest study in the world, that is exactly the
study I want." The good President proved his statement to my
satisfaction by showing the relation of Greek and Roman civilizations
to the spread of Christianity and the education of Europe.</p>

<p>In Germany I first learned the true method, and at the
same time, the most practicable ways and means of studying
and teaching history. Amid a pleasant variety of academic
courses by brilliant lecturers like Kuno Fischer, Zeller, Ernst
Curtius, Grimm, Treitschke, Droysen, Du Bois Raymond, Lepsius,
and others, I somehow felt a lack of educational unity and
system. There was need of some backbone to unite the skeleton
of human deeds and historic experiences. This I found at last
in the teachings of my old master, Dr. J. C. Bluntschli, at Heidelberg.
In his lecture courses on the State, on the Constitutional
Law, on Politics and on the International Law of Modern Civilized
States, I first began to realize that government and law are
the real forces which bind society and the world together. I
began to see that the true unity of the world's life is to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in the succession of States, Empires, Federations, and in the
International Relations, which are slowly leading to such great
aggregations as the United States of America and the United
States of Europe. In Germany I learned from a reading of
Bluntschli's various writing, including many noble articles in
his Staatsworterbuch, that there is such a thing as the World-State
now in process of evolution. From the published records
of the Institute of International Law, of which Dr. Bluntschli
was the president, and from a study of the subjects of Arbitration
and International Tribunals, I thought I could dimly discern
the beginnings of that Parliament of Man, the Federation
of the World, of which the Poet Tennyson sings in his Locksley
Hall.</p>

<p>When I came to Baltimore three ideas of study and teaching
were uppermost in my mind: (1) the study of the origins of
municipal life, in order to find out whether it was Roman or
Germanic; (2) the study of the relations of Church and State,
from their beginning down to the present, for I had learned to
believe in Germany that the separation of civil from religious
society is America's greatest contribution to the world's progress;
(3) the continued study of art history for its own sake and
as illustrating the history of civilization.</p>

<p>Out of the first of these ideas, developed by a reading of the
works of Sir Henry Maine, has grown my Historical Seminary
and a long series of University Studies in Historical and Political
Science (chiefly on Municipal, Economic and Institutional
themes). Out of the second idea evolved successive courses of
lectures on Church and State, or Religion and Government in
the Ancient and Graeco-Roman World, together with my whole
system of graduate instruction upon the Early History of Society,
Greek and Roman Polities, Jewish and Church History,
and certain modern States like Prussia and France. The third
idea never had a good chance for development until recent years
when I have fairly begun to realize my original conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
illustrating in concrete, artistic ways the progress of civilization.</p>

<p>Goldwin Smith, in his Lecture on History, says there can
be no philosophy of history until we realize the unity of the
human race and that history must be studied as a whole.
Twenty years ago, at the Johns Hopkins University, I began
to teach Local History, as representative of Universal History.
I began with New England Village Communities, with Plymouth
Plantations, Salem and the Massachusetts Bay Towns, those
little republics which seemed to me the very protoplasm of State
life. The survival, continuity or revival of old Germanic forms
of village settlement, with common fields and town commons,
impressed my imagination and interested my students. They
carried this kind of study into this State of Maryland and
original papers by Maryland boys were published upon such
subjects as Parishes, Manors, and other local institutions. These
lines of inquiry were extended down the Atlantic seaboard to
Virginia and the Carolinas. Gradually the field of interest has
been widened from towns, plantations, parishes, and counties
until now the constitutional, economic and educational history
of entire States is in review or contemplation.</p>

<p>While I still believe in Local History and in limited subjects
of student research, I now recognize more fully than I used
to do, the importance of General History, especially for college
students and college graduates in the early part of their course.
After all, the great fact in History, as well as in Geography,
is that the world is round. You must recognize all human experience
on this globe as parts of one great whole, just as you
recognize that the continents and outlying islands are but related
parts of one vast geographical system. In every properly arranged
course of school and college instruction in the domain
of History, this doctrine of unity ought to be taken for granted.
It is like the doctrine of divine unity in theology or in nature,
like the sun in our heavens. It gives light and rationality to
any and every course of study.</p>

<p>I used to think that it was the first duty of a boy to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the history of his own State and country; but I am now persuaded
that he should know the history of mankind and of the
world. Nobody would study geography or geology from a
purely local point of view. You must have a consciousness of
the whole in order to appreciate the parts of any subject. It is
a mistake to imagine that a boy or girl cares most for what is
nearest and most familiar. Children are always gifted with imagination.
They rejoice in the thought of lands that are far off,
of men who lived in olden times. They take the greatest pleasure
in heroic tales of Cyrus and of Hannibal, of Horatius and
of the great twin brethren, Castor and Pollux. Mythology, minstrelsy,
Bible stories, and lives of great wariors, explorers, discoverers,
inventors, these are of supreme interest to boys and
girls. American History should be taught to American youth,
but chiefly the heroic, the romantic, the biographical, in short
the more human sides of our colonel and national life.</p>

<p>History begins and ends with Man. Biographical approaches
to the world's life are the oldest, and best beaten paths
for youth to follow. Carlyle and Froude are among the champions
of the biographical method of studying and teaching History.
When Froude succeeded Freeman at Oxford the biographical
idea was at once brought to the front. Froude quoted
Carlyle as saying: "The history of mankind is the history of its
great men; to find out these, clean the dirt from them, and place
them on their proper pedestals, is the true function of the historian."
And Froude, the new professor, entered at once upon
those splendid and inspiring courses of lectures, in which the
personal and biographical elements entered so strongly.</p>

<p>Every American student should read Froude's lectures on
"English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century," that brilliant account
of Sir Francis Drake, Sir John Hawkins, and the great
captains of England who gained a new world for Elizabeth and
defeated the Spanish Armada. You should also read Froude's
Lectures on the "Life and Letters of Erasmus" if you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
understand the relation of the great religious reform to the new
learning, which Erasmus represented.</p>

<p>Is it not wonderful that by reading a brief biography, which
perhaps occupies our leisure hours for a week, we can grasp and
understand the life-work of a great man? Think of it! A whole
life in one book. A whole history is in one of Plutarch's chapters.
By turning to that new series of biographies called "Heroes
of the Nations," you can study or teach the lessons derived
from the lives and characters of such great men as Pericles,
Cicero, Julius Caesar, Julian the Philosopher, Theodoric the
Goth, Wyclif, the first of the English reformers, Prince Henry
the Navigator, Henry of Navarre, Sir Philip Sidney, Gustavus
Adolphus, Napoleon, Nelson, and Lincoln. Another excellent
biographical series is that called "English Men of Action," published
by Macmillan, and containing such noble lives as those of
Wolfe, the conqueror of Quebec; David Livingstone, the Explorer
of Africa, Lord Lawrence and Sir Henry Havelock, the
saviors of India; General Gordon, the Hero of Khartoum. If
your taste runs toward literature, you should read select biographies
in the series called "English Men of Letters," embracing
such characters as Gibbon, Carlyle, Byron, Shelly, and Hume.
There is a corresponding American series, edited by Charles
Dudley Warner, and embracing such men as Washington Irving,
J. Fenimore Cooper, and Edgar Allan Poe. But among all biographies
for boys and young men I know nothing better than
the Autobiography of Franklin. This has encouraged and quickened
many young Americans to a desire of knowledge and self-culture.</p>

<p>But let no student or teacher believe for one moment that
historical biography is the full equivalent of History. Not all
the biographies that have ever been written could possibly contain
the world's great life. As the poet Tennyson truly says:
"The individual withers, but the world is more and more."
There must be great men in Church and State, to lead society forward,
but there must be unnumbered thousands, yea millions,
of good men and true, and of faithful, devoted women, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to support good leadership and carry humanity forward from
generation to generation. It is often the biography of some
plain man or self-sacrificing woman that affords the greatest
encouragement and incentive to ordinary humanity. But we
must remember that no man, no woman is worthy of biographical
or historical record, unless in some way he or she has contributed
to the welfare of society and the progress of the world. Only
those deeds which affect our fellow men in some noteworthy
manner are fit for commemoration. What you do as a private individual,
what you ate for breakfast, what you do in the seclusion
of your own room, is not necessarily historic; but whether
Napoleon was able to eat his breakfast on the morning of the
Battle of Waterloo, or whether an army has been properly fed,
may have the greatest historic significance.</p>

<p>Not man alone, but man in organized society, is the subject
of History. Man in his relation to his fellows, man as a military,
political, social, intellectual, and religious being may become
historic. Dr. Thomas Arnold sometimes defined History as the
biography of nations. This is a large and noble conception, although
not the largest, and it may be profitably emphasized, like
human biography in the study and teaching of History. It is
the duty of every school and college to lay great stress upon the
history of England and of the United States in addition to
General History. We all need to know the lives of our own
people as well as the lives of great Englishmen like Pitt and
Gladstone, and great Americans like Washington and Lincoln.
We should teach and study the histories of those nations which
are nearest our mother country&mdash;Scotland, France, Germany,
and Italy. As Germany is now the great seat of culture and of
university life for American students who go abroad, so was
Italy for wandering English students in the days of the Renaissance.
English literature from that time onward is pervaded
with Italian elements, with the influences of "all Etruscan
three," Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and also with the ideas
of Machiavelli and the Italian historians. We cannot understand
the literature of England or America without going back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to its French and Italian sources. It would be wise for college
professors of history to devote special attention to the Italian
Renaissance or Revival of Learning, without which an understanding
of the German Reformation and modern education is
an impossibility.</p>

<p>In reading the biography of men or the biography of nations,
teachers and students should note carefully the most interesting
and memorial points. If you own the book which you are
reading, use for note-taking the fly leaves at the end. Otherwise,
use reference cards, like those employed in a library for a card
catalogue, or else sheets of note paper. When you have found a
fact or illustration which you think will prove useful at some
future time, in connection with your work as a teacher or a student,
note it briefly on paper with the proper reference to the
book and page. Remember Captain Cuttle's advice: "When
found, make a note of!" Recall the saying of Lord Bacon:
"Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing
an exact man. And, therefore, if a man write little, he had
need have a great memory."</p>

<p>In the multitude of modern books and amid all the variety of
our modern reading, it is impossible to remember exact quotations
and historical details. We must have a good system of note-taking
and index-making. Every student and teacher can invent
his own system. Mine is the use of fly leaves in books and
cards topically and alphabetically arranged for miscellaneous
data. I always carry a few of these reference cards in my pocket
and make all my notes under appropriate catch words, for example,
"Chautauqua" or "Johns Hopkins University," with
the name of the writer on this subject and the exact reference
or quotation.</p>

<p>Begin to collect a library for yourselves. Students and
teachers do not always appreciate the opportunities they enjoy
of acquiring good books of History. I would strongly urge students
to save their money instead of spending it on poor theaters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and variety shows. Buy standard books of literature, art,
and history; devote your leisure hours to good reading, always
with pen and pencil in hand, and with a dictionary and an atlas
beside you. <i>Seize the moment of excited curiosity</i> and look up
every point on which you need exact information. One of my
former students, Dr. Albert Shaw, now editor of The Review
of Reviews, said he was more grateful to me for that advice than
for any other one feature of my instruction: <i>Seize the moment
of excited curiosity</i>, or it will be lost forever.</p>

<p>An English writer, Langford, in his <i>Praise of Books</i>, well
says: "In books the past is ours as well as the present. With
them we live yesterday over again. All the bygone ages are with
us, and we look on the face of the infancy of the world. We see
the first dawning of thought in man. We are present at the beginnings
of cities, states, and nations; and can trace the growth
and development of governments, policies, and laws. The marvelous
story of humanity is enacted again for our edification, instruction,
and delight. We behold civilizations begin, struggle,
triumph, and decay, giving place to higher and nobler as they
pass away. Poet, lawgiver, and soldier sing their songs, make
their codes, and fight their battles again, while we follow the
never-dying effects of song, of law, and of battle. We sit down
with 'princes, potentates, and powers,' watching them, as they
think, governing the world.... Shut up in a little room we can
witness the whole drama of man's history played on the vast
stage of the world. All that he has thought and done from the
earliest dawn of recorded time to our own day is enacted before
us; and our hopes are strengthened, our faith deepened, in the
great destiny yet awaiting mankind; in the higher, holier work
yet to be done by those who have accomplished such mighty
things, achieved such noble victories. Books which record the
history of the past are the infallible and unerring prophets of
the future."</p>

<p>"History is the grandest study in the world." My College
President, Dr. Julius H. Seelye, was right. There is no art or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
science comparable to it, for it embraces the whole experience of
man in organized society. History takes hold of all the past and
points the way to all the future. The French historian, Guizot,
in his "History of My Time" (III. 162) says: "Religion opens
the future and places us in the presence of eternity. History
brings back the past and adds to our own existence the lives of
our fathers." Pliny said of History: "Quanta potestas, quanta
dignitas, quanta majestes, quantum denique numen sit historiae."
Perhaps the highest conception of History comes from the
Greek. The etymology of the ward is an inspiration for both
student and teacher. History, from the Greek word historia,
is a knowing or learning by inquiry. To study History is to
understand by means of research, for History is a science; its
very essence consists in knowledge. Historical science is perhaps
the most comprehensive and the noblest of all sciences, for
it is the self-knowledge of Humanity. The subject of History
is Humanity itself; it is the self-conscious development of the
human race. History, therefore, does not consist in dead facts,
but is itself a living fact; it is the self-knowledge of the present
with regard to its evolution from the past. Clio is a living muse,
not a dead, cold form. She stands upon that very threshold of
the future and glances backwards over the long vista Humanity
has traversed. In the plastic art of the Greeks you will notice
that the muse of History is represented in the attitude of reflection;
the pen is uplifted, but the word unwritten.</p>

<p>We sometimes speak of written history and of its standard
works as though the essence of that science consisted in books
and not in knowledge. "There are no standards of history,"
said Droysen, a German professor to an American student who
had asked his advice respecting the choice of standard works
for an historical library. In this caustic saying there lies a profound
truth. History is a living, self-developed science, not a
collection of fossils. Books like facts, are sometimes dead to history,
and historical standards, like historical facts, are grander
in their spiritual influence than in their material form. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
onward march of historical science, historians are perhaps the
standard bearers of fact and their works may be called the battle-flags
of history which kindle the zeal of the ever-advancing
present in men and awaken a sense of unity with the great past,
which has gone on before us. But written history often becomes
shot-riddled by criticism and is set away, at last, like battle-flags,
after many honorable campaigns, in some museums of relics or
some temple of fame. Unless such trophies continue to awaken
in the living present a sort of enthusiasm and a sense of unity
with the past experience of our race, then are our historic standards
but antiquarian rubbish, indeed, as useless and unmeaning
as the banners and symbols of heraldry.</p>

<p>The subject of History is the self-conscious development of
the human race, the Ego of Humanity. The realization of this
Ego does not lie in any fictitious personality, but in the universal
consciousness that man is one in all ages and that the individual
human mind may mirror to itself and to others the thought and
experience of the race. As the heavens are reflected in a single
drop of dew, so in the thoughts of the individual human mind
we may sometimes behold a reflection of the self-knowledge of
Humanity. For the individual is sometimes the very best expression
of the whole with which it stands in connection. The
onward march of world-history seems to have concentrated itself
in the development of individual peoples like the Jews, Greeks,
Romans, and the Germanic peoples. As these nations best typify
historic progress and certain world-historic ideas, so the historic
thought of manhood may be most fully realized by individual
minds. For example, a single historian, like Thucydides, may
reflect the self-consciousness of his age, and a single mind, in our
own day, may realize, in some measure, at least through the
works of history, the self-knowledge, the Ego of Humanity. It
should be the aim of every student of History thus to realize in
his own consciousness the historic thought of mankind. "The
life of each individual," says Dr. W. T. Harris, the American
Hegel, "presupposes the life of the race before him, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
individual cannot comprehend himself without comprehending
first the evolution of his day and generation historically from
the past."</p>

<p>Let us then regard the study of History, not as something
wholly objective but as an unfolding panorama of the human
self-consciousness, for history is merely the reflecting spirit of
mankind in which we ourselves may have an immediate share,
which we all may help to perpetuate and in some way enlarge.
Let us remember that History is a constant knowing and learning,
the self-knowledge and communion of reflecting spirits in all
ages and a perpetual "Know Thyself" to advancing time. There
is something indescribably solemn in the historic pausing of
Man before the temple of the unknown future and seeking to
realize in himself the <i>gnothi seauton</i> or "Know Thyself" of Humanity.
He glances backward through the long vista he has
traversed and as far as the eye can see, his pathway is cumbered
with ruins. Crumbling monuments and fallen columns reveal
the wreck of all material greatness, while the distant pyramids
but remind him of the more than Egyptian darkness out of
which Humanity has been mysteriously led unto this mountain
of light which we call the Present or that Living Age. Man sees
the immense distance he has come and he remembers the perils
and disasters he has encountered in his upward way; he is conscious
too of having brought a vast wealth of experience to this
temple of the Future before which he now stands, but that which
fills and overwhelms the historic consciousness of Man is the
feeling that the place whereon he stands is holy ground and that
there is a mysterious power in his own soul calling him to self-knowledge
and to self-judgment before he may lift the veil of
the future. This is the supreme moment of History. The facts
of human experience become suddenly transfigured in the light
of a divine principle, namely the self-consciousness of reason,
that God-given spirit which recognizes the purpose of History
to be the increasing self-knowledge of Man.</p>

<p>"History is a divine drama, designed to educate man into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
self-knowledge and the knowledge of God," (Henry James, Sr.,
on "Carlyle," in Atlantic Monthly, May, 1881.) Tennyson recognized
the divine element in human history in that prophetic
verse:</p>

<div class="poem">
"And I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,<br />
And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns."<br />
</div>

<p>It is by this "increasing purpose" that God reveals himself
in human history. By the widened thought, Humanity is led forward,
as it were by a pillar of fire, unto a higher life, and unto
a conscious unity with Divine Reason, the Unseen One, who
dwells in a temple not made with hands.</p>

<h2>SOME FACTS CONCERNING THE SETTLEMENT AND EARLY HISTORY OF MISSISSIPPI.</h2>

<div class="center">By R. W. JONES, M. A., LL.D.</div>


<p>The "Miscellaneous Papers" as collected by Col. J. F. H.
Claiborne constitute a rich mine for the future historian. They
also indicate what can be done by others by well-direct inquiry,
in the way of gathering information from "old settlers" and by
going to other sources that may be accessible. The importance of
this work can be scarcely overstated, and the sooner it is begun
the better. A volume could be written composed of adventures
and daring exploits that would be as thrilling as highly wrought
fiction and make us proud of our ancestors. As an illustration
of the large number of well known characters introduced, within
a limited space, and of most interesting and instructive incidents
I shall quote from a letter of</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">DR. A. R. KILPATRICK</div>

<p>to Col. Claiborne, written at Navasota, Grimes county, Texas,
May 2, 1877:</p>

<p>* * "You ask for my contributions to De Bow's Review,
but I am entirely unable to furnish them. When I left Concordia,
La., in September, 1863, I moved none of my books, and the
scoundrel in whose hands I left the place proved to be a traitor
joined the Yankees, and when Natchez was occupied he went
partners with some of the Federal officers, who brought over
several wagons, gutted my house and sold the furniture and other
property in Natchez. Out of a library of 2,000 volumes I have
none left. Among my books were (12) twelve volumes of De
Bow's Review bound." In these twelve volumes Dr. K. had written
a great deal that was interesting and instructing to those who
inquire into the settlement and colonial history of Mississippi.
They contain accounts of many of the best known families who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
lived at and near Natchez and Woodville and in the counties
wherein these towns are situated; also similar writings concerning
Concordia, La.</p>

<p>He says; "Before I wrote those accounts of Concordia
Parish, I wrote some Sketches of the early Baptist in Mississippi
and Louisiana which were printed in a Baptist newspaper
of New Orleans under the management of a Minister named Duncan:
I think he was Rev. W. Duncan, D. D. Get copies of those
papers and make use of the historical facts, because your work
will be incomplete if you leave out the churches. These papers
were published about 1849-51.</p>

<p>"My Grandfather (Maternal), Robert Turner, was an early
settler in Miss., and a pioneer of the Baptist Church, though not
a minister. He moved a colony of nearly (100) one hundred,
white and black from Beaufort District, S. C., starting in 1804.
He went up near Nickajack on the Tennessee River, built boats,
put on his horses, cows, hogs, furniture and floated down to
Natchez, reaching there early in 1805, he found there no settlement
to suit, went down to Fort Adams, landed, and settled four
miles S. W., of where Woodville now stands. There they built
old Bethel Church with whipsawed lumber and wrought iron
nails, each one furnishing his part of materials, or work. The
Chaplain or preacher of the colony was Rev. Moses Hadley. At
that time, 1805, there were only a few houses, temporary shanties,
where Woodville is. Ole Uncle Bob Lecky, who kept hotel
so many years in Alexandria, La., and old John S. Lewis of
Woodville, were the first to put up houses. My Grandfather,
R. Turner was a Surveyor and was employed to measure and
lay off the streets, squares, etc., of the town in 1808. He was
also summoned and served in the arrest of Aaron Burr above
Natchez about 1807; he said it was so cold in February that in
handling oars of the skiff the blood poured from the tips of his
fingers. He represented Aaron Burr as remarkably polite,
genteel, urbane, good looking, though small, and as having eyes
whose glance was most penetrating and fascinating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was another party of pioneers from Georgia, preceding
Grandfathers; in this party were the Ogdens and Nolands."</p>

<p>"Captain John Ogden, near Woodville, (1796-1837) served
as Captain at the battle of New Orleans, 1814. Robert Tanner
and several of his colonists moved to Rapides Parish, La. There
the old gentleman died September, 1839, of yellow fever, aged
71 years. Wilkinson county furnished one Governor (H. Johnson)
to Louisiana and (4) four, I think, to Mississippi.</p>

<p>"The old original editor of the Woodville Republican, W.
Chisholm, had all the volumes of that paper bound for over
twenty years&mdash;from about 1820 to 1845. In it will be found much
of Poindexter's history; also much of Moses Waddell, of Abbeville,
S. C., brother-in-law of John C. Calhoun."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rev. Wm. Winans, D. D., lived and died at Mount Pleasant,
about sixteen miles east southeast of Woodville. Major Butler,
of Kentucky, lived there; also General Van Dorn's father.
Major Butler served in General Wilkinson's command. The general
was very strict in regard, not only to his own dress, but also
the dress, etc., of the officers and men under him. It was the
fashion then to wear the hair long and plait it into a queue, or
pig-tail behind. General Wilkinson had the misfortune to lose
his pig-tail and issued an order for all to cut off their pig-tails.</p>

<p>Major Butler refused; Wilkinson threatened court martial;
Butler resigned and retired to the farm of his sister, Mrs. Cook.
In a few months he died; before dying he left special injunctions
with Mr. and Mrs. Cook to have an auger-hole bored in his coffin,
to have his hair neatly dressed and the pig-tail tied with a blue
ribbon and run through that auger-hole, so that Wilkinson and
his officers might see that he was pluck to the last and distained
his authority.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin L. Riley, in a lecture, gives another version of
this incident, which is very amusing. Dr. Kilpatrick narrates
many incidents concerning Governor Poindexter, Mr. Percy,
Audubon, Jeff Davis and others.</p>

<p>The Audubon mentioned by him was the distinguished John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
James Audubon, the Naturalist. Born 1781, in Louisiana, died
1851, on the Hudson; Author of Birds of America, Quadrupeds
of America, etc. Audubon was at the house of Mr. Percy, spent
several months with him; he furnished Audubon with many
specimens of birds for his sketches. One day Percy says he
brought home a "magnificent gobbler" which weighed about 28
pounds and Audubon <i>would have it</i>. He pinned it up beside the
wall so as get a good view of it and spent several days lazily
sketching it. Percy said: "The &mdash;&mdash; fellow kept it pinned
up there till it rotted and stunk. I hated to lose so much good
eating."</p>

<p>It is said that while Aububon was at or near Woodville, his
money gave out; he refused to accept gifts; but taught a dancing
school, in order to get funds sufficient to enable him to proceed
with his researches in Natural History. The people patronized
him generously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Jeff. Davis spent part of his boyhood in Wilkinson county,
Miss. There was a boy on a place adjoining where Jeff. Davis
lived named Bob Irion, son of a Baptist preacher. The two boys
went hunting one day, each alone, and after some time they met
behind a field. Jeff. Davis was out of shot and Bob was out of
powder, but had shot. Davis wanted some shot and asked for
some, but Bob was unaccommodating and saucy&mdash;jeered at Davis,
and finally told him he had a mind to shoot him any how, and
made some threatening demonstration which aroused Davis.
Davis jerked out a small pocket knife dropped it down his gun
on the load of powder and raised his gun and said: "Now, sir,
I'm ready for you; I dare you to shoot.' Bob told me this himself
during the Mexican campaign, as illustrating Davis' bravery and
fertility of resources in emergencies. Of course the boys stopped
their foolishness and exchanged ammunition." * *</p>

<p>"I got on the Sultana at Fort Adams when S. S. Prentiss
was aboard on his bridal trip&mdash;married that morning at Natchez,
and the whole bridal troupe went down to New Orleans. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
my first sight and acquaintance with Prentiss. I was charmed
with his manners and appearance. He had the most handsome
head, and it sat better on his neck and shoulders than any person
I know. That was in 1843, when his fame was world wide;
yet, sir, he was as bashful, timid and quiet as a boy of 16 in the
presence of those ladies."</p>

<p>"At table he had nothing to say, but ate his meals quietly,
almost stealthily. But as soon as he came down in the social
hall, he was lively and chatted enough."</p>

<p>I could give other extracts of value and interest from this
same letter, but I will not worry you. I hope it will not be long
before this letter and other important historical manuscripts
will be printed.</p>

<h2>PRE-HISTORIC JASPER ORNAMENTS IN MISSISSIPPI</h2>

<div class="center">R. B. FULTON, M. A., LL. D.</div>


<p>In the annual Report of the Smithsonian Institute for 1877,
Dr. Chas. Rau, under the title of "The Stock-in-Trade of an
Aboriginal Lapidary," emphasizes his conjecture "that among
the aborigines certain individuals who were by inclination or
practice particularly qualified for a distinct kind of manual
labor, devoted themselves principally or entirely to that labor."
He referred to several instances where, in certain localities, finds
of a large number of similarly wrought specimens of work in
stone seemed to indicate that each set of specimens came from
the hands of a special lapidary.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of these deposits was found in
Lawrence County, Mississippi, in 1875, and was carefully described
by Dr. Rau. It consisted of 469 imperfectly finished objects
made by chipping, cutting and grinding out of reddish or orange-colored
or brown jasper pebbles, and was found accidentally
about two and one-half feet below the surface of the ground in
the northern part of Lawrence County,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The objects were evidently
intended for ornaments, and when finished all would have
been polished and probably perforated. The majority were cylindrical
in shape, and varied from one-fourth to one inch in diameter
and from one-fourth to three inches in length. Others were
roughly fashioned into ornamental shapes. Several showed an
attempt at perforation, and one, not received at the National
Museum, was said to be completely perforated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>When the hardness of the material used&mdash;jasper&mdash;is considered,
the patience and skill needed to give their form and polish
to these objects command admiration. From the fact that only
one specimen was perforated completely, one might readily suppose
that the workman found the difficulties of this part of his
undertaking too great, and buried his unfinished work in despair.</p>

<p>Some time ago there came into my hands a set of similar articles
found in the county of Lincoln, Mississippi, about twenty-five
miles west of the spot where the above-mentioned find was
made.</p>

<p>These last found objects were exhibited at the Cleveland
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, in the hope of learning whether similar specimens had
been found, as they appeared to me at that time to be entirely
unique.</p>

<p>Following out suggestions made at that meeting by several
gentlemen, and afterward by two of the best informed Southern
archaeologists, I found that the above-mentioned region in Mississippi
has yielded a number of carved, polished and perforated
objects of this hard red or brown quartzite (or jasper), and nearly
all such specimens of this material which I have been able to
learn about came from this region.</p>

<p>The collection of specimens of this style of workmanship described
by Dr. Rau probably contains the majority of pieces
extant. A few specimens of polished jasper ornaments from other
States than Mississippi are shown in the National Museum. There
are two or three specimens from Indiana, one from California,
and one from Louisiana (Claiborne Parish), which seem to be
similarly made and from the same material.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Joseph Jones of New Orleans had in his collection
some jasper ornaments, mostly from Mississippi, including
a beautiful ceremonial ax of reddish translucent jasper.</p>

<p>Besides those mentioned I have not been able to learn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
other similar objects. Probably there are a few scattered ones
in other hands.</p>

<p>The collection of these objects in my possession includes
thirty pieces. They were found on a farm four miles west of
Wesson, in Lincoln County. And were plowed up on the summit
of a hill where no earthworks were noticed. A few other relics
were found at the same time and were not preserved. With them
were two other beads, one of a gray stone and the other of bone
very truly shaped, as if in a lathe.</p>

<p>Among the jasper ornaments (all of which are perforated
longitudinally with holes from one-tenth to one-eighth of an
inch in diameter) are three cylinders between two and a half
and three inches long and about one-fourth of an inch in diameter;
ten cylinders ranging from a quarter to an inch and a
quarter in length and less than one-quarter in diameter; five
nearly spherical beads; one accurately shaped short cylinder
three-quarters of an inch long and five-eighths in diameter, with
a well-drilled perforation three-eights of an inch in diameter;
and ten carved ornaments of various shapes. One of these, an inch
long, is a strikingly sculptured deer. Four are evidently intended
for birds, and four others resemble each other and in form are
indistinctly bird-like. A separate ring of the same material is
firmly fixed on one of the long beads.</p>

<p>All of the specimens have evidently seen service as personal
ornaments. They have a fine polish externally, and the interior
of the borings is worn smooth as by a string. An artistic color-perception
is shown in the beautiful variety of tints brought out
in various pieces of jasper used.</p>

<p>As to all these ornaments in red jasper mentioned in this
paper, comparison of the specimens forcibly suggests that they
may be the work of one skilled artist. In the western pebble belt
of Mississippi, which extends along the border of the Mississippi
and Yazoo river bottoms southward from near Memphis to
Natchez, and thence eastward through the counties in which these
relics have been found, quartzite of almost every variety occurs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and chipped implements of almost every variety and color are
common. The maker of these ornaments has passed by all other
tints save red and brown. In the cylindrical and other carved
forms that have been found there is a striking similarity both
in design and workmanship.</p>

<p>One will readily believe the perforation of these ornaments
with small and accurately made drillings to have been the most
difficult part of their manufacture. And yet in all the specimens
seen the perforations have been in the <i>longest</i> direction through
the ornament. The total length of the borings in the set of thirty
beads I have is twenty-eight inches. A lapidary not remarkably
expert in the art of drilling these holes would probably have
simplified his work by shorter borings, arranging the ornaments
as pendants.</p>

<p>Again, the rarity of any objects of carved or polished or
perforated quartzite suggests a very limited manufacture even
in the region under consideration.</p>

<p>As to the means used in making these perforations, drills of
stone are excluded from consideration on account of the smallness
and length of the borings.</p>

<p>There is one specimen in the collection of Dr. Joseph Jones
of New Orleans, in which a boring has been began, evidently
with a hollow tube as a drill, probably a joint of a reed fed with
sand, as there is a core in the centre of the boring; but hollow
drills as small as one-twelfth of an inch in diameter could scarcely
have been used. Some of the specimens described by Dr. Rau
show the beginning of the drilling process, apparently with a
solid drill, fed with sand.</p>

<p>We are forced to the conclusion that the drilling implement
used must have been a needle of copper, or more probably of
the hard outer wood of the Southern cane tipped with quartz, or

<h2>SUGGESTIONS TO LOCAL HISTORIANS.</h2>

<div class="center">BY FRANKLIN L. RILEY, PH. D.</div>


<p>Local research must precede the writing of general history.
It discovers and renders available the materials from which history
is made. For this reason the local historian largely determines
the character and extent of all history. The facts with
which he deals may be considered as mere historical digits, yet
in the aggregate they represent the entire life of a people. In
fact their true value is not fully revealed until they are tested by
their relation to State history and to still larger movements.
The apparent insignificance of the local annal disappears when
it is recognized as one of a thousand threads out of which is
woven the great and beautiful fabric of human history. Hence,
as has been truly said, "local history is not isolated; it is a part
of State history&mdash;&mdash;indeed of national and world history."</p>

<p>One of the most pressing needs in Mississippi is a more
efficient organization for local historical work. Societies should
be organized in the various historical and intellectual centers of
the State. Such an organization has been effected among the
students of the University of Mississippi. The formation of similar
societies throughout the State would awaken an interest in
Mississippi history. This should not be limited, however, to our
institutions of learning. It is also desirable to enlist in the great
work of perpetuating our history the many noble men and women
who have helped to make it.</p>

<p>Another great need is a system for the proper direction of
the various lines of research that should be followed out in the
State. The best results can accrue from such organizations only
by a system for the unification of efforts and the preservation
of results. Without such a system the results achieved by the
historical renaissance upon which we are entering will be largely
lost. This necessity is shown by our past experience in work
of this kind. In 1876 many counties of the State, acting in accordance
with a suggestion of the President of the United States,
held centennial celebrations, at which were delivered many addresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of historical value. With the exception of an incomplete
collection of these addresses which were gathered into the archives
of the State Historical Society upon its organization,
several years later, these contributions to our history have either
been lost entirely, or are not now available to investigators. By
having a common place of deposit for these results of historical
investigation our workers will be able to learn readily what has
been done along various lines of research and will often be
saved a duplication of effort.</p>

<p><i>Plan of Organization.</i>&mdash;The charter of the Mississippi Historical
Society gives it authority to establish branches in the various
counties of the State. In order to put such a scheme into
practical execution, the Executive Committee of the Society has
adopted the following resolution, looking toward a unification of
all the historical work of the State:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. That all of the patriotic and historical organizations of the
State, including local historical societies; the Daughters of the Revolution;
the department of Mississippi United Confederate Veterans, and
the Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy may, by a resolution duly
passed and filed with the Secretary of the State Historical Society, become
affiliated with said society and entitled to all the benefits accruing
therefrom.</p>

<p>2. That any such auxiliary society may, by the first of December
annually, make a report of its work to the Secretary of the State Historical
Society, which, or portions, or a synopsis thereof, may be included
in the publications of the State Society, and upon application
of an auxiliary society the State Society may become custodian of the
records of such auxiliary society.</p>

<p>3. That a copy of the publication of the State Historical Society
be sent, free of charge, to such auxiliary societies as make annual reports
as provided above.</p></blockquote>


<div class="center">PURPOSE OF AFFILIATION.</div>

<p>1. <i>Encouragement of Research.</i>&mdash;It is the purpose of the
State Society to encourage investigation by giving proper recognition
to all worthy contributions that may be made to our history.
This will be done both by the public presentation of papers
from local societies at the annual meetings and by their publication
and distribution by the State Society.</p>

<p>2. <i>Unification of Work and Preservation of Results.</i>&mdash;This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is the day of co-operation in historical work. A great and noble
task lies before us. We cannot afford to duplicate work or to
lose any worthy contributions that may be made to our history.
Let us not repeat the experience of 1876. Again some of our
most important subjects can be worked only by local aid in various
parts of the state. This aid can be furnished by the members
of organizations in the locality from which information is desired.</p>


<div class="center">SUGGESTIONS.</div>

<p><i>Character of Work Needed.</i>&mdash;The historian should above
all things keep himself free from prejudice. It will be impossible
to stop investigation and the historian must ever keep in mind
the fact that sooner or later his work will be tested by others
and his errors brought to light. The value and permanence of
all historical work, therefore, is quite in proportion to the amount
of truth it contains. "Particularly must he," says one, "guard
against careless or incorrect statements about the dead who
cannot defend themselves." Every assertion should be susceptible
of proof and exact references should be made in foot-notes
to the authority upon which a statement is based. If this be neglected,
says the writer quoted above, the work stands in danger
either of neglect by future historians, or of being discredited as
a mass of unsubstantial statements.</p>

<p><i>Sources of Information.</i>&mdash;The most fruitful and accessible
sources of information on local history are the following: State
histories; public records (municipal, county, church, school,
etc.); newspaper files; books and pamphlets pertaining to the
locality under consideration; manuscript letters, journals, etc.,
of early settlers; and interviews with the oldest inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Scope of Work Needed.</i>&mdash;In Mississippi the following topics
would doubtless yield rich returns to the local historian. The list
might be enlarged or changed to meet local conditions.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The name and location of Indian tribes and
the events, dates and incidents in their history together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
their present condition in some counties in the State would
doubtless prove fruitful to the investigator. Closely allied to
this is the subject of archaeology. Although we have no large
public collection of pre-historic implements in Mississippi there
are several excellent private collections in different parts of the
State. These should be cited for the use of investigators.</p>

<p><i>Early Settlements.</i>&mdash;This opens a fertile field that has been
too much neglected in Mississippi. The local historian should
gather up the annals and letters of the first settlers. He should
as far as possible ascertain the former homes of settlers and the
facts that led to their removal as well as those which determined
the location of settlements. Closely allied to this is the development
of early thoroughfares. The investigator might also give
the early experience as well as the domestic and social customs of
the pioneers.</p>

<p><i>Biography.</i>&mdash;The lives of men that have contributed to the
greatness of our State. We do not know enough about our statesmen,
scientists, poets, teachers, philanthropists, authors, etc.</p>

<p><i>Groups of Foreign Settlers.</i>-Although this field is limited
in Mississippi, we have not done this work. The Irish settlement
in Jasper county and perhaps a few others in the State might
be worked with much interest and profit.</p>

<p><i>Military History.</i>&mdash;The old militia system and the part
taken by the county in the wars in which the United States has
engaged need to be investigated now, since those who took part
in these events are fast disappearing.</p>

<p><i>Political History.</i>&mdash;This subject might embrace county
boundaries, their establishment and location, the origin and development
of political parties within the county; the establishment
of municipalities, etc.</p>

<p><i>Religious and Social History.</i>&mdash;The sources by way of church
records are abundant. The growth of churches, philanthropic
movements and reforms may be included under this subject.</p>

<p><i>Educational History.</i>&mdash;This would embrace not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
public schools of to-day, but private schools of ante bellum times.</p>

<p><i>Industrial and Commercial Development.</i>&mdash;The local historian
might show the effects of topography, soil and natural
resources upon the occupations and economic conditions of the
county. Industrial and commercial methods should be treated
and statistics given. In this connection the influences of slavery
should be noted.</p>

<p><i>Miscellaneous Topics of a Local Nature.</i>&mdash;The following
subjects might be studied with results more or less satisfactory,
according to location: Tory Influences, Railways, Newspapers,
Architecture, Contents of Early Libraries, Reconstruction, etc.</p>

<h2>SOME INACCURACIES IN CLAIBORNE'S HISTORY IN REGARD TO TECUMSEH.</h2>

<div class="center">BY H. S. HALBERT</div>


<p>In this article the writer desires to call attention to some
inaccuracies in Colonel J. F. H. Claiborne's History of Mississippi,
on page 487, in regard to Tecumseh's visit to the Choctaws.
These inaccuracies have unfortunately misled the authors
of our Mississippi school histories, and I wish here to present
the subject in its true light and so correct these inaccuracies for
the benefit of all students of Mississippi history. As a beginning,
I will state that in 1877 I sent to Colonel Claiborne, then engaged
in writing his history, some notes which I had written in
regard to Tecumseh's visit to the Choctaws in 1811. These notes
gave some account of the last council between Tecumseh and the
Choctaws, which was held on Blewett's plantation, in Noxubee
County. Subsequent research, several years after, showed that
I was in error on some points. Still, if Colonel Claiborne had
made use of my notes just as they were, the matter would not
have been so bad. I regret, however, to say that Colonel Claiborne
took much liberty with my narrative and added thereto
some fictitious embellishments. To take a liberal view of the matter,
the Colonel, no doubt, considered these embellishments as
harmless and as adding somewhat to the interest of the narrative.
After the manner of some historians of antiquity, the
Colonel had acquired the habit of putting fine speeches into the
mouths of his Indian heroes. For the benefit of the students of
Mississippi history, I will here state, in all truth and good conscience,
that the speech which he has put into the mouth of Pushmataha
is nothing more nor less than pure and unadulterated
fiction. Pushmataha never made that speech. Even the uncritical
school boy might ask the questions: "Who was the reporter in
the Indian camp that took down that speech?" "Who translated
the speech from Choctaw into English?" The Truth is, Colonel
Claiborne simply composed that speech and interpolated it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
my meager narrative. The Colonel, too, seems to have been utterly
oblivious or regardless of the fact, that, in all Indian inter-tribal
councils, where more than one language is spoken, all the
business is transacted through the cold medium of interpreters.
Under such circumstances there can be no wonderful displays
of impassioned oratory. Pushmataha spoke only Choctaw, Tecumseh
only Shawnee. A speech delivered by Tecumseh in his native
tongue could not have been understood by the Choctaws. Hence,
all the arguments and statements on both sides had to pass
through the mouth of the interpreter; in this case the interpreter,
Seekaboo. Such inter-tribunal councils are strictly business
conferences. Many years ago it was my fortune to be present at
two inter-tribal councils among the wild tribes, where several
languages were spoken, and no displays of oratory were attempted&mdash;for
in such a case the speaker's tribesmen alone could have
understood him&mdash;but everything was conducted in practical,
businesslike manner, the interpreters kept constantly busy translating
the statements of the speakers.</p>

<p>Reverting to Colonel Claiborne and Tecumseh, I will state
that elsewhere I have given all the attainable facts in regard to
Tecumseh's Choctaw visit, worked out from original and authentic
sources. Suffice it here to say that Tecumseh in none of his
councils exerted the slightest influence over Moshulitubbee, over
Hopaii Iskitini, nor over any other Choctaw, chief or warrior.
The Choctaw mingoes unanimously and utterly discountenanced
his designs, and at the last council threatened to put him to death
if he did not leave their nation.</p>

<p>Again, on this same page, there is an inaccuracy in regard
to the conference which Weatherford and Ochillie Hadjo had
with Mingo Moshulitubbee. In this case, however, Colonel Claiborne
is not blameable, as I made the mistake myself in the notes
which I sent him. Subsequent inquiry showed that I was in error
on this matter, so I here correct the statement by saying that
Moshulitubee was not influenced in the slightest degree by
these Muscogee chiefs. This conference is an historic fact, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I received from the late Mr. G. W. Campbell, of Shuqulak, he
receiving it in early life from Stonie Hadjo, one of Moshulitubees'
captains. Circumstances show that this conference occurred
in the summer of 1813, perhaps in July.</p>

<p>My object in making these corrections is, that, as I am the
only person who knows about these erroneous statements in Claiborne's
history, I may place the facts in their true light for the
benefit of all lovers of historical accuracy.</p>

<h2>DID JONES COUNTY SECEDE?</h2>

<div class="center">BY ALEXANDER L. BONDURANT, A. M.</div>


<p>It seems that many within and without the State would
answer this query in the affirmative, and even their ordinance
of secession is given by one writer on the subject as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whereas, The State of Mississippi, for reasons which appear
justifiable, has seen fit to withdraw from the Federal Union;
and</p>

<p>"Whereas, We, the citizens of Jones County, claim the same
right, thinking our grievances are sufficient by reason of an
unjust law passed by the Confederate States of America forcing
us to go into distant parts, etc., therefore, be it</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That we sever the union heretofore existing between
Jones County and the State of Mississippi, and proclaim
our independence of the said State and of the Confederate States
of America; and we solemnly call upon Almighty God to witness
and bless the act."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such being the case, it has seemed to me in order to advert
to a discussion in the Nation on this subject beginning March
24, 1892, which throws considerable light on the question. In
the paper of this date Samuel Willard, of Chicago, writes that
he had been a soldier in the army which invaded Mississippi,
and that he had never during the war heard of such an occurrence.
When, therefore, he saw the statement made in the New
England Magazine, for November, 1891, the author being Professor
Hart, he doubted its accuracy. It may be stated just here
that Professor Hart, in a subsequent issue of the Nation gives
as his authority Mr. Galloway, historian of the Sixth army corps,
who published in the Magazine of American History for October,
1886, an article entitled "A Confederacy Within a Confederacy;"
but upon what authority Mr. Galloway based his statements
does not appear. He therefore wrote to the Governor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the State of Mississippi and to the clerk of Jones County, and
elicited replies from both of these gentlemen, and Governor
Stone inclosed a letter from his predecessor, Hon. Robert Lowry,
who was sent to Jones County during the war in command of
troops for the purpose of arresting deserters. The texts of the
letters are too long to quote in full, so a few passages will have
to suffice. Governor Stone writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It gives me pleasure to inform you that the whole story
is a fabrication, and there is scarcely any foundation for any
part of it. To begin with Jones County furnished perhaps as
many soldiers to the army of the Confederacy as any other county
of like population. * * * Many of them declined to go
into the army in the beginning, but so far as formal withdrawal
or resolution to that effect is concerned, no such thing ever occurred
in Jones County. Hon. Robert Lowry was sent to Jones
County during the war for the purpose of arresting and returning
deserters to their commands, and there was some little
fighting with these bands of deserters, or rather bush-whacking
of his men by the deserters; and some of the deserters were arrested
and executed, but only a few. The whole story is the veriest
fabrication, and I presume few persons of intelligence will
believe any of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Ex-Governor Lowry writes: "The county furnished nearly
and probably its entire quota of soldiers, many of whom did
splendid service. No such effort as establishing a separate government
was ever attempted. The story of withdrawal and establishing
of a separate government is a pure fabrication&mdash;not a shadow
of foundation for it."</p>

<p>Governor McLaurin, in a recent letter to me on this subject,
writes: "I was a boy thirteen years old when the war commenced.
I was 'raised' in Smith County, a county adjoining
Jones. I was at home the first three years of the war, and, if
there was any attempt by Jones County to secede and set up a
separate government, I did not hear anything of it. I was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
brigade that intercepted a Federal raid that started from Baton
Rouge to Mobile in November or December, 1864, and we passed
through or very near Jones County, and I never heard of any
attempt to set up a separate government in the county. I think
it is safe for you to negative the whole story."</p>

<p>E. B. Sharp, Esq., chancery clerk, writes: "The report is
utterly false in every particular."</p>

<p>The authority of these well known gentlemen is quite sufficient
to dispose effectually of this canard reflecting upon the
good name of a county which rendered brave and efficient service
to the Confederacy.</p>

<p>The so-called "case system" of study is applied to almost all
branches of the law, but its application to constitutional law has been
retarded by the obvious impracticability of referring a class to the
original reports and by the wants of a suitable case book of moderate
size. It is to meet such requirements that this collection has been
formed.</p>

It is very evident that Mr. Pinckney understood the circumstances that
determined the course of the Spanish Minister. See American State

the standpoint of Louisiana, says (History of La., 269) that this was
also understood by the King's officers in New Orleans.

The United States and England had previously agreed that they
would share equally in the navigation of the Mississippi and on May 4,
1796, six months after the treaty with Spain, the United States and
England subscribed to the following: "No other stipulation or treaty
concluded since (the date of their former treaty) by either of the contracting
parties with any other Power or Nation, is understood in any
manner to derogate from the right to the free communication and commerce
guaranteed by the 3d article or the treaty to the subjects of His
Brittanic Majesty."&mdash;Amer. State P. For. Rels. II. 15. In a letter to
the Spanish Minister, Chevalier de Yrujo, dated January 20, 1798, Mr.
Pickering says that the United States "have not asked, nor will they
have occasion to ask Spain to be the guardian of their rights an interests
on the Mississippi."&mdash;Ib. 102.</p></div>

instructions from the Spanish court, prepared an elaborate memoir on
the political situation in America. "He represented the people of the
United States as extremely ambitious, as animated by the spirit of
conquest and as anxious to extend their empire to the shores of the
Pacific. He then suggested a line of policy, which in his opinion, it
was incumbent on Spain to adopt. The dismemberment of the western
country, by means of pensions and commercial benefits, was considered
by him as not difficult. The attempt was therefore strongly urged,
particularly as it would, if successful, greatly augment the power of
Spain in this quarter and forever arrest our progress westward. These
suggestions were favorably received, and formed the groundwork of
that policy which Spain afterwards pursued."&mdash;Sketches of La., 98.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Ellicott had made the surveys locating the limits of the District
of Columbia, in 1791 (Chas. Burr Todd's Story of Washington, 21).
The year following he was appointed to draft and publish a plan of the
Federal City (Ib. 30). He also established the Meridian of Washington,
conducted several other important public surveys and served a
number of years as Surveyor General of the United States. In 1813,
General Armstrong appointed him Professor of Mathematics in the
United States' Military Academy at West Point, which position he held
for several years. He was in constant communication with the National
Institute of France and contributed to the Transactions of the
American Philosophical Society. His official dispatches while engaged
as Commissioner for locating the boundary between the United States
and Spain may be found in the American State Papers, Foreign Relations,
Vol. II. A more extensive account is given in narrative form in
Ellicott's Journal, published at Philadelphia, in 1803. All his writings
with reference to Mississippi must be read with caution, since they exhibit
intense partisan animus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The day after beginning his descent of the Mississippi, he and his
party reached "the station of one of the Spanish gallies, the master of
which treated them politely, but detained them until the next day
(Journal, 31). A few hours after leaving this point, they reached New
Madrid, where they were saluted upon landing "by a discharge of the
artillery from the fort and otherwise treated with the greatest respect
and attention." Here the commandant stated that he had "a communication
to make and for some reasons, which he did not detail," requesting
Ellicott "to continue there two or three days." The commissioner
declined to be detained longer than one day. At the expiration of that
time a letter was produced from the Governor General of the province,
containing an order issued about three months previous, not to permit
the Americans to descend the river till the posts were evacuated, which
could not be effected until the waters should rise." In reply, Ellicott
took the position that "if want of water was an objection ... it was ...
done away by the commencement of the inundation," that such an
order must have been intended for troops and that to detain himself
and party "would be an indirect violation of the treaty" they were
preparing to carry into effect. The objection was then withdrawn and
they proceeded (Ib. 31-33). At Chickasaw Bluffs the Commandant
received the party politely but "appeared embarrassed" (Ib. 34) and
affected almost total ignorance of the treaty. There were no appearances
of preparations to evacuate (Ib. 35). Again resuming their voyage,
they were detained a few days later, for about an hour, by a Spanish
officer commanding two galleys(Ib. 36). At Walnut Hills (Vicksburg)
they were brought to by an "unnecessary" discharge of a piece
of artillery, but were treated "very civilly when on shore." Here also
the commandant "appeared to be almost wholly unacquainted" with
the treaty and was not satisfied until Ellicott produced "an authenticated
copy" of that instrument in Spanish (Ib. 37). This incident appeared
very extraordinary to the Commissioner in view of the fact
that this station was "in the vicinity" of Natchez, where Governor
Gayoso resided (Ib. 38).
</p>
<p>
All of these occurrences were more extraordinary still, when viewed
in the light of the further facts observed by Professor Hinsdale:&mdash;Although
Ellicott "bore a commission from the Government of the
United States, was accompanied by an escort of American troops and
was charged with the performance of a duty created by a solemn international
agreement, he was halted and questioned as though he were
a suspect in a strange country. Moreover, the one bank of the river,
throughout the whole distance, Spain had acknowledged to belong exclusively
to the United States, to say nothing of her having guaranteed
its navigation by American citizens from its source to the sea" (Annual
Rept. Amer. Hist. Association for 1893, pp. 351-2).</p></div>

am pretty sure that both the French and Spaniards have emissaries
among the Indians" (Ib.). The Secretary of State received a letter
from Winthrop Sargent, at Cincinnati, bearing date of June 3, 1797, in
which he says, "it ... appears from various channels, that they (the
Spaniards) are inviting a great number of Indians of the (Northwest)
territory to cross the Mississippi.... A large party of the Delawares
passed down White River about the 6th of May, on their way to the
Spanish side, bearing the national flag sent from St. Louis" (Ib. 88).</p></div>

circumstance for the United States, though in doing it, he did not
strictly comply with his orders from General Wayne, by whom he was
instructed to remain at Fort Massac till he obtained some information
respecting the evacuation of the posts, and if a judgment was to be
formed from the provision made for the detachment, it could not be
supposed that it was really intended to descend the river. It was in
want of artillery, tents, money, medicines, and a physician. In consequence
of this omission, or bad management, I had to furnish the men
such articles as they were in need of, out of the stores appropriated
for carrying the treaty into effect. And after all that I was able to do,
we had (to our great mortification) to borrow some tents from the
Governor" (Ellicott's Journal, 80).</p></div>

three-quarters of a mile east of Hebron and were sent to the Smithsonian
by Mr. T. J. R. Keenan. In the field where these objects were
found, the outlines of a pre-historic fort could be easily traced until a
few years ago.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> Since the above paper was written I have obtained one jasper
bead, found fifteen miles north of Hot Springs, Ark. It is cylindrical in
form, one inch long, one-fourth of an inch in external diameter, and has
a longitudinal perforation one-tenth of an inch in diameter. The material
resembles that of the set found in Mississippi. I have also seen several
perforated jasper ornaments in the possession of Prof. J. G.
Deupree, of the University of Mississippi, which were found in Copiah
county, Mississippi, and I have been informed that several similar objects
are in the possession of persons in Copiah County.
</p>
<p>
It will be noted that the quartzite, or jasper, of which these ornaments
are made, is a very different material from the comparatively
soft and easily-worked red sandstone&mdash;"Catlinite"&mdash;extensively used
by the Indians of the Northwest in the manufacture of pipes and ornaments.</p></div>
